## Console Scripts
SeleniumBase console scripts help you get things done more easily, such as installing web drivers, creating a test directory with necessary configuration files, converting old WebDriver unittest scripts into SeleniumBase code, translating tests into multiple languages, and using the Selenium Grid.

Type ``seleniumbase`` on the command line to use console scripts.

(<i>For running tests, [use **pytest** with SeleniumBase](../../help_docs/customizing_test_runs.md).</i>)

### install
* Usage:
``seleniumbase install [DRIVER_NAME]``
        (Drivers: ``chromedriver``, ``geckodriver``, ``edgedriver``,
                  ``iedriver``, ``operadriver``)

* Example:
``seleniumbase install chromedriver``

* Output:
Installs the specified webdriver.
(``chromedriver`` is required for Google Chrome automation)
(``geckodriver`` is required for Mozilla Firefox automation)
(``edgedriver`` is required for Microsoft Edge automation)
(``iedriver`` is required for Internet Explorer automation)
(``operadriver`` is required for Opera Browser automation)

### mkdir
* Usage:
``seleniumbase mkdir [DIRECTORY_NAME]``

* Example:
``seleniumbase mkdir browser_tests``

* Output:
Creates a new folder for running SeleniumBase scripts.
The new folder contains default config files,
sample tests for helping new users get started, and
Python boilerplates for setting up customized
test frameworks.

### convert
* Usage:
``seleniumbase convert [PYTHON_WEBDRIVER_UNITTEST_FILE]``

* Output:
Converts a Selenium IDE exported WebDriver unittest file
into a SeleniumBase file. Adds ``_SB`` to the new
file name while keeping the original file intact.
Works with Katalon Recorder scripts.

### translate
* Usage:
``seleniumbase translate [SB_FILE].py [LANGUAGE] [ACTION]``

* Languages:
``--en`` / ``--English``    |    ``--zh`` / ``--Chinese``
``--nl`` / ``--Dutch``      |    ``--fr`` / ``--French``
``--it`` / ``--Italian``    |    ``--ja`` / ``--Japanese``
``--ko`` / ``--Korean``     |    ``--pt`` / ``--Portuguese``
``--ru`` / ``--Russian``    |    ``--es`` / ``--Spanish``

* Actions:
``-p`` / ``--print``  (Print translation output to the screen)
``-o`` / ``--overwrite``  (Overwrite the file being translated)
``-c`` / ``--copy``  (Copy the translation to a new ``.py`` file)

* Output:
Translates a SeleniumBase Python file into the language
specified. Method calls and "import" lines get swapped.
Both a language and an action must be specified.
The ``-p`` action can be paired with one other action.
When running with ``-c`` (or ``--copy``), the new file name
will be the orginal name appended with an underscore
plus the 2-letter language code of the new language.
(Example: Translating "test_1.py" into Japanese with
``-c`` will create a new file called "test_1_ja.py".)


### extract-objects
* Usage:
``seleniumbase extract-objects [SB_PYTHON_FILE]``

* Output:
Creates page objects based on selectors found in a
seleniumbase Python file and saves those objects to the
"page_objects.py" file in the same folder as the tests.

### inject-objects
* Usage:
``seleniumbase inject-objects [SB_PYTHON_FILE] [OPTIONS]``

* Options:
``-c``, ``--comments``  (Add object selectors to the comments.)

* Output:
Takes the page objects found in the "page_objects.py"
file and uses those to replace matching selectors in
the selected seleniumbase Python file.

### objectify
* Usage:
``seleniumbase objectify [SB_PYTHON_FILE] [OPTIONS]``

* Options:
``-c``, ``--comments``  (Add object selectors to the comments.)

* Output:
A modified version of the file where the selectors
have been replaced with variable names defined in
"page_objects.py", supporting the Page Object Pattern.
(This has the same outcome as combining
``extract-objects`` with ``inject-objects``)

### revert-objects
* Usage:
``seleniumbase revert-objects [SB_PYTHON_FILE] [OPTIONS]``

* Options:
``-c``, ``--comments``  (Keep existing comments for the lines.)

* Output:
Reverts the changes made by ``seleniumbase objectify ...`` or
``seleniumbase inject-objects ...`` when run against a
seleniumbase Python file. Objects will get replaced by
selectors stored in the "page_objects.py" file.

### download
* Usage:
``seleniumbase download [ITEM]``
        (Options: server)

* Example:
``seleniumbase download server``

* Output:
Downloads the specified item.
(server is required for using your own Selenium Grid)

### grid-hub
* Usage:
``seleniumbase grid-hub {start|stop}``

* Options:
``-v``, ``--verbose``  (Increases verbosity of logging output.)

* Output:
Controls the Selenium Grid Hub server, which allows
for running tests on multiple machines in parallel
to speed up test runs and reduce the total time
of test suite execution.
You can start, restart, or stop the Grid Hub server.

### grid-node
* Usage:
``seleniumbase grid-node {start|stop} [OPTIONS]``

* Options:
``--hub=HUB_IP`` (The Grid Hub IP Address to connect to.) (Default: ``127.0.0.1``)
``-v``, ``--verbose``  (Increases verbosity of logging output.)

* Output:
Controls the Selenium Grid node, which serves as a
worker machine for your Selenium Grid Hub server.
You can start, restart, or stop the Grid node.
