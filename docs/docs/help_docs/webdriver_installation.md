## Installing webdrivers
To run web automation, you'll need to download webdrivers for each browser you plan on using, and then place those on your System **[PATH](http://java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)**. Additionaly, you can place drivers in the [SeleniumBase `drivers` folder](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/drivers). If you plan on taking the latter option, here are some commands that'll automatically download the driver you need into the ``drivers`` folder once you've installed SeleniumBase:

```bash
seleniumbase install chromedriver
seleniumbase install geckodriver
seleniumbase install edgedriver
seleniumbase install iedriver
seleniumbase install operadriver
```
* If you have the latest version of Chrome installed, get the latest chromedriver (<i>otherwise it defaults to chromedriver 2.44 for compatibility reasons</i>):
```bash
seleniumbase install chromedriver latest
```

If you plan on using the [Selenium Grid integration](../seleniumbase/utilities/selenium_grid/ReadMe.md) (which allows for remote webdriver), you'll need to put the drivers on your System PATH. On macOS and Linux, ``/usr/local/bin`` is a good PATH spot. On Windows, you may need to set the System PATH under Environment Variables to include the location where you placed the driver files. As a shortcut, you could place the driver files into your Python ``Scripts/`` folder in the location where you have Python installed, which should already be on your System PATH.

Here's where you can go to manually install web drivers from the source:

* For Chrome, get [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) on your System PATH.

* For Firefox, get [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) on your System PATH.

* For Microsoft Edge, get [Edge Driver (Microsoft WebDriver)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) on your System PATH.

* For Safari, get [Safari Driver](using_safari_driver.md) on your System PATH.

* For Opera, get [Opera Chromium Driver](https://github.com/operasoftware/operachromiumdriver/releases) on your System PATH..

* For PhantomJS headless browser automation, get [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) on your System PATH. (NOTE: <i>PhantomJS is no longer officially supported by SeleniumHQ</i>)

**macOS**:

* You can also install drivers by using ``brew`` (aka ``homebrew``), but you'll need to install that first. [Brew installation instructions are here](install_python_pip_git.md).

```bash
brew cask install chromedriver

brew install geckodriver
```

(NOTE: If your existing version of chromedriver is less than 2.44, **upgrading is required** in order to keep up with the latest version of Chrome!)

```bash
brew cask upgrade chromedriver

brew upgrade geckodriver
```

**Linux**:

If you still need the web drivers, here are some scripts to help you install chromedriver and geckodriver on a Linux machine:

```bash
wget http://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/2.44/chromedriver_linux64.zip
unzip chromedriver_linux64.zip
mv chromedriver /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/chromedriver
```

```bash
wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.26.0/geckodriver-v0.26.0-linux64.tar.gz
tar xvfz geckodriver-v0.26.0-linux64.tar.gz
mv geckodriver /usr/local/bin/
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/geckodriver
```

* If you wish to verify that web drivers are working, **[follow these instructions](verify_webdriver.md)**.
