## Installation
If you're installing SeleniumBase from a cloned copy on your machine, use:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python setup.py install
```

If you're installing SeleniumBase directly [from PyPI (the Python Package Index)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seleniumbase), use:
```bash
pip install seleniumbase
```

If you're installing SeleniumBase [from a GitHub branch](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase), use:
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git@master#egg=seleniumbase
```

Useful ``pip`` options include:
* Add ``--upgrade`` OR ``-U`` to upgrade an installation.
* Add ``--force-reinstall`` for a clean install.

(If you're not using a virtual environment, you may need to add ``--user`` to your ``pip`` command if you're getting errors during installation.)
