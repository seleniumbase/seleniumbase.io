Get Started: Requires Python and Git A Python virtual env is recommended. See shortcut . Upgrade pip to prevent warnings: python -m pip install -U pip Install SeleniumBase: git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git cd SeleniumBase/ pip install -r requirements.txt python setup.py install If multiple versions of Python are installed, be specific (E.g. use python3 instead of python ). You can also install seleniumbase from pypi : pip install seleniumbase Add --upgrade OR -U to upgrade an installation. Add --force-reinstall to also upgrade dependencies. Download a webdriver: SeleniumBase can download a webdriver to the seleniumbase/drivers folder with the install command: seleniumbase install chromedriver You need a different webdriver for each web browser you want to run automation on: chromedriver for Chrome, edgedriver for Edge, geckodriver for Firefox, operadriver for Opera, and iedriver for Internet Explorer. If you have the latest version of Chrome installed, get the latest chromedriver ( otherwise it defaults to chromedriver 2.44 for compatibility reasons ): seleniumbase install chromedriver latest Run a test on Chrome: cd examples/ pytest my_first_test.py Chrome is the default browser if not specified with --browser=BROWSER . On Linux --headless is the default behavior (running with no GUI). You can also run in headless mode on any OS. If your Linux machine has a GUI and you want to see the web browser as tests run, add --headed or --gui . Run my_first_test.py in Demo Mode: pytest my_first_test.py --demo Here's the code for my_first_test.py : from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_basic ( self ): self . open ( \"https://xkcd.com/353/\" ) self . assert_title ( \"xkcd: Python\" ) self . assert_element ( 'img[alt=\"Python\"]' ) self . click ( 'a[rel=\"license\"]' ) self . assert_text ( \"free to copy and reuse\" ) self . go_back () self . click ( \"link=About\" ) self . assert_text ( \"xkcd.com\" , \"h2\" ) self . open ( \"://store.xkcd.com/collections/everything\" ) self . update_text ( \"input.search-input\" , \"xkcd book \\n \" ) self . assert_exact_text ( \"xkcd: volume 0\" , \"h3\" ) By default, CSS Selectors are used for finding page elements. If you're new to CSS Selectors, games like Flukeout can help you learn. Here are some common SeleniumBase methods you might find in tests: self . open ( URL ) # Navigate to the web page self . click ( SELECTOR ) # Click a page element self . update_text ( SELECTOR , TEXT ) # Type text (Add \"\\n\" to text for pressing enter/return.) self . assert_element ( SELECTOR ) # Assert element is visible self . assert_text ( TEXT ) # Assert text is visible (has optional SELECTOR arg) self . assert_title ( PAGE_TITLE ) # Assert page title self . assert_no_404_errors () # Assert no 404 errors from files on the page self . assert_no_js_errors () # Assert no JavaScript errors on the page (Chrome-ONLY) self . execute_script ( JAVASCRIPT ) # Execute javascript code self . go_back () # Navigate to the previous URL self . get_text ( SELECTOR ) # Get text from a selector self . get_attribute ( SELECTOR , ATTRIBUTE ) # Get a specific attribute from a selector self . is_element_visible ( SELECTOR ) # Determine if an element is visible on the page self . is_text_visible ( TEXT ) # Determine if text is visible on the page (optional SELECTOR) self . hover_and_click ( HOVER_SELECTOR , CLICK_SELECTOR ) # Mouseover element & click another self . select_option_by_text ( DROPDOWN_SELECTOR , OPTION_TEXT ) # Select a dropdown option self . switch_to_frame ( FRAME_NAME ) # Switch webdriver control to an iframe on the page self . switch_to_default_content () # Switch webdriver control out of the current iframe self . switch_to_window ( WINDOW_NUMBER ) # Switch to a different window/tab self . save_screenshot ( FILE_NAME ) # Save a screenshot of the current page For the complete list of SeleniumBase methods, see: Method Summary Learn More \u00b6 Automatic WebDriver abilities \u00b6 SeleniumBase automatically handles common WebDriver actions such as spinning up web browsers and saving screenshots during test failures. ( Read more about customizing test runs . ) Simplified code \u00b6 SeleniumBase uses simple syntax for commands, such as: self . update_text ( \"input\" , \"dogs \\n \" ) The same command with regular WebDriver is very messy: ( And it doesn't include SeleniumBase smart-waiting. ) from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By element = self . driver . find_element ( by = By . CSS_SELECTOR , value = \"input\" ) element . clear () element . send_keys ( \"dogs\" ) element . submit () As you can see, the old WebDriver way is very bad! Use SeleniumBase to make testing much easier! ( You can still use self.driver in your code. ) Run tests with pytest or nosetests in any browser \u00b6 ( Using pytest is recommended. Chrome is the default browser. ) pytest my_first_test.py --browser = chrome nosetests test_suite.py --browser = firefox All Python methods that start with test_ will automatically be run when using pytest or nosetests on a Python file, ( or on folders containing Python files ). You can also be more specific on what to run within a file by using the following: ( Note that the syntax is different for pytest vs nosetests. ) pytest [ FILE_NAME ] .py:: [ CLASS_NAME ] :: [ METHOD_NAME ] nosetests [ FILE_NAME ] .py: [ CLASS_NAME ] . [ METHOD_NAME ] No more flaky tests \u00b6 SeleniumBase methods automatically wait for page elements to finish loading before interacting with them ( up to a timeout limit ). This means you no longer need random time.sleep() statements in your scripts. Automated/manual hybrid mode \u00b6 SeleniumBase includes a solution called MasterQA , which speeds up manual testing by having automation perform all the browser actions while the manual tester handles validatation. Feature-Rich \u00b6 For a full list of SeleniumBase features, Click Here . Detailed Instructions \u00b6 Here's how to run the example script on various web browsers: First install a webdriver for each browser you intend to use: seleniumbase install chromedriver seleniumbase install geckodriver seleniumbase install edgedriver seleniumbase install iedriver seleniumbase install operadriver Next, choose between pytest and nosetests test runners. ( Mostly interchangeable. ) cd examples/ pytest my_first_test.py --browser = chrome nosetests my_first_test.py --browser = firefox ( If no browser is specified, Chrome is used by default. ) With Pytest, a green dot means a test passed. An \"F\" means a test failed. Use Demo Mode to help you see what tests are asserting. If the example test is moving too fast for your eyes, you can run it in Demo Mode by adding --demo on the command-line, which pauses the browser briefly between actions, highlights page elements being acted on, and lets you know what test assertions are happening in real time: pytest my_first_test.py --demo Pytest includes test discovery. If you don't specify a specific file or folder to run from, pytest will search all subdirectories automatically for tests to run based on the following matching criteria: Python filenames that start with test_ or end with _test.py . Python methods that start with test_ . The Python class name can be anything since SeleniumBase's BaseCase class inherits from the unittest.TestCase class. You can see which tests are getting discovered by pytest by using: pytest --collect-only -q You can use the following in your scripts to help you debug issues: ( If using ipdb, make sure you add \"-s\" to command-line options unless already in pytest.ini ) import time ; time . sleep ( 5 ) # Makes the test wait and do nothing for 5 seconds. import ipdb ; ipdb . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. import pytest ; pytest . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. To pause an active test that throws an exception or error, add --pdb -s : pytest my_first_test.py --pdb -s The code above will leave your browser window open in case there's a failure. (ipdb commands: 'n', 'c', 's' => next, continue, step). Here are some useful command-line options that come with Pytest: -v # Prints the full test name for each test. -q # Prints fewer details in the console output when running tests. -x # Stop running the tests after the first failure is reached. --html = report.html # Creates a detailed pytest-html report after tests finish. --collect-only # Show what tests would get run without actually running them. -n = NUM # Multithread the tests using that many threads. (Speed up test runs!) -s # See print statements. (Should be on by default with pytest.ini present.) --junit-xml = report.xml # Creates a junit-xml report after tests finish. --pdb # If a test fails, pause run and enter debug mode. (Don't use with CI!) -m = MARKER # Only run tests that are marked with the specified pytest marker. SeleniumBase provides additional Pytest command-line options for tests: --browser = BROWSER # (The web browser to use.) --cap-file = FILE # (The web browser's desired capabilities to use.) --cap-string = STRING # (The web browser's desired capabilities to use.) --settings-file = FILE # (Overrides SeleniumBase settings.py values.) --env = ENV # (Set a test environment. Use \"self.env\" to use this in tests.) --data = DATA # (Extra data to pass to tests. Use \"self.data\" in tests.) --var1 = DATA # (Extra data to pass to tests. Use \"self.var1\" in tests.) --var2 = DATA # (Extra data to pass to tests. Use \"self.var2\" in tests.) --var3 = DATA # (Extra data to pass to tests. Use \"self.var3\" in tests.) --user-data-dir = DIR # (Set the Chrome user data directory to use.) --server = SERVER # (The server / IP address used by the tests.) --port = PORT # (The port that's used by the test server.) --proxy = SERVER:PORT # (This is the proxy server:port combo used by tests.) --agent = STRING # (This designates the web browser's User Agent to use.) --mobile # (The option to use the mobile emulator while running tests.) --metrics = STRING # (\"CSSWidth,Height,PixelRatio\" for mobile emulator tests.) --extension-zip = ZIP # (Load a Chrome Extension .zip file, comma-separated.) --extension-dir = DIR # (Load a Chrome Extension directory, comma-separated.) --headless # (The option to run tests headlessly. The default on Linux OS.) --headed # (The option to run tests with a GUI on Linux OS.) --start-page = URL # (The starting URL for the web browser when tests begin.) --archive-logs # (Archive old log files instead of deleting them.) --time-limit = SECONDS # (Safely fail any test that exceeds the limit limit.) --slow # (The option to slow down the automation.) --demo # (The option to visually see test actions as they occur.) --demo-sleep = SECONDS # (The option to wait longer after Demo Mode actions.) --highlights = NUM # (Number of highlight animations for Demo Mode actions.) --message-duration = SECONDS # (The time length for Messenger alerts.) --check-js # (The option to check for JavaScript errors after page loads.) --ad-block # (The option to block some display ads after page loads.) --verify-delay = SECONDS # (The delay before MasterQA verification checks.) --disable-csp # (This disables the Content Security Policy of websites.) --enable-sync # (The option to enable \"Chrome Sync\".) --use-auto-ext # (The option to use Chrome's automation extension.) --incognito # (The option to enable Chrome's Incognito mode.) --guest # (The option to enable Chrome's Guest mode.) --devtools # (The option to open Chrome's DevTools when the browser opens.) --reuse-session # (The option to reuse the browser session between tests.) --crumbs # (Option to delete all cookies between tests reusing a session.) --maximize-window # (The option to start with the web browser maximized.) --save-screenshot # (The option to save a screenshot after each test.) --visual-baseline # (Set the visual baseline for Visual/Layout tests.) --timeout-multiplier = MULTIPLIER # (Multiplies the default timeout values.) (For more details, see the full list of command-line options here .) During test failures, logs and screenshots from the most recent test run will get saved to the latest_logs/ folder. Those logs will get moved to archived_logs/ if you add --archive_logs to command-line options, or have ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS set to True in settings.py , otherwise log files with be cleaned up at the start of the next test run. The test_suite.py collection contains tests that fail on purpose so that you can see how logging works. cd examples/ pytest test_suite.py --browser = chrome pytest test_suite.py --browser = firefox An easy way to override seleniumbase/config/settings.py is by using a custom settings file. Here's the command-line option to add to tests: (See examples/custom_settings.py ) --settings_file=custom_settings.py (Settings include default timeout values, a two-factor auth key, DB credentials, S3 credentials, and other important settings used by tests.) To pass additional data from the command-line to tests, add --data=\"ANY STRING\" . Now inside your tests, you can use self.data to access that. Test Directory Customization: For running tests outside of the SeleniumBase repo with Pytest , you'll want a copy of pytest.ini on the root folder. For running tests outside of the SeleniumBase repo with Nosetests , you'll want a copy of setup.cfg on the root folder. (Subfolders should include a blank __init__.py file.) These files specify default configuration details for tests. (For nosetest runs, you can also specify a .cfg file by using --config . Example nosetests [MY_TEST].py --config=[MY_CONFIG].cfg ) As a shortcut, you'll be able to run seleniumbase mkdir [DIRECTORY_NAME] to create a new folder that already contains necessary files and some example tests that you can run. Example: seleniumbase mkdir ui_tests cd ui_tests/ pytest my_first_test.py Logging / Results from Failing Tests: Let's try an example of a test that fails: \"\"\" test_fail.py \"\"\" from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_find_army_of_robots_on_xkcd_desert_island ( self ): self . open ( \"https://xkcd.com/731/\" ) self . assert_element ( \"div#ARMY_OF_ROBOTS\" , timeout = 1 ) # This should fail You can run it from the examples folder like this: pytest test_fail.py You'll notice that a logs folder, \"latest_logs\", was created to hold information about the failing test, and screenshots. During test runs, past results get moved to the archived_logs folder if you have ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS set to True in settings.py , or if your run tests with --archive-logs . If you choose not to archive existing logs, they will be deleted and replaced by the logs of the latest test run. Creating Visual Test Suite Reports: (NOTE: Several command-line args are different for Pytest vs Nosetests) Pytest Reports: Using --html=report.html gives you a fancy report of the name specified after your test suite completes. pytest test_suite.py --html = report.html You can also use --junit-xml=report.xml to get an xml report instead. Jenkins can use this file to display better reporting for your tests. pytest test_suite.py --junit-xml = report.xml Nosetest Reports: The --report option gives you a fancy report after your test suite completes. nosetests test_suite.py --report (NOTE: You can add --show-report to immediately display Nosetest reports after the test suite completes. Only use --show-report when running tests locally because it pauses the test run.) Using a Proxy Server: If you wish to use a proxy server for your browser tests (Chrome and Firefox only), you can add --proxy=IP_ADDRESS:PORT as an argument on the command-line. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = IP_ADDRESS:PORT If the proxy server that you wish to use requires authentication, you can do the following (Chrome only): pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_ADDRESS:PORT To make things easier, you can add your frequently-used proxies to PROXY_LIST in proxy_list.py , and then use --proxy=KEY_FROM_PROXY_LIST to use the IP_ADDRESS:PORT of that key. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = proxy1 Changing the User-Agent: If you wish to change the User-Agent for your browser tests (Chrome and Firefox only), you can add --agent=\"USER AGENT STRING\" as an argument on the command-line. pytest user_agent_test.py --agent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo 3DS; U; ; en) Version/1.7412.EU\" Building Guided Tours for Websites: Learn about SeleniumBase Interactive Walkthroughs (in the examples/tour_examples folder). It's great for prototyping a website onboarding experience. Production Environments & Integrations: Here are some things you can do to setup a production environment for your testing: You can setup a Jenkins build server for running tests at regular intervals. For a real-world Jenkins example of headless browser automation in action, check out the SeleniumBase Jenkins example on Azure or the SeleniumBase Jenkins example on Google Cloud . You can use the Selenium Grid to scale your testing by distributing tests on several machines with parallel execution. To do this, check out the SeleniumBase selenium_grid folder , which should have everything you need, including the Selenium Grid ReadMe , which will help you get started. If you're using the SeleniumBase MySQL feature to save results from tests running on a server machine, you can install MySQL Workbench to help you read & write from your DB more easily. If you use Slack , you can easily have your Jenkins jobs display results there by using the Jenkins Slack Plugin . Another way to send messages from your tests to Slack is by using Slack's Incoming Webhooks API . If you're using AWS, you can setup an Amazon S3 account for saving log files and screenshots from your tests. To activate this feature, modify settings.py with connection details in the S3 section, and add \" --with-s3-logging \" on the command-line when running your tests. Here's an example of running tests with additional features enabled: pytest [ YOUR_TEST_FILE ] .py --with-db-reporting --with-s3-logging Detailed Method Specifications and Examples: Navigating to a web page (and related commands) self . open ( \"https://xkcd.com/378/\" ) # This method opens the specified page. self . go_back () # This method navigates the browser to the previous page. self . go_forward () # This method navigates the browser forward in history. self . refresh_page () # This method reloads the current page. self . get_current_url () # This method returns the current page URL. self . get_page_source () # This method returns the current page source. ProTip\u2122: You may need to use the get_page_source() method along with Python's find() command to parse through the source to find something that Selenium wouldn't be able to. (You may want to brush up on your Python programming skills for that.) source = self . get_page_source () head_open_tag = source . find ( '<head>' ) head_close_tag = source . find ( '</head>' , head_open_tag ) everything_inside_head = source [ head_open_tag + len ( '<head>' ): head_close_tag ] Clicking To click an element on the page: self . click ( \"div#my_id\" ) ProTip\u2122: In most web browsers, you can right-click on a page and select Inspect Element to see the CSS selector details that you'll need to create your own scripts. Typing Text self.update_text(selector, text) # updates the text from the specified element with the specified value. An exception is raised if the element is missing or if the text field is not editable. Example: self . update_text ( \"input#id_value\" , \"2012\" ) You can also use self.add_text() or the WebDriver .send_keys() command, but those won't clear the text box first if there's already text inside. If you want to type in special keys, that's easy too. Here's an example: from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys self . find_element ( \"textarea\" ) . send_keys ( Keys . SPACE + Keys . BACK_SPACE + ' \\n ' ) # The backspace should cancel out the space, leaving you with the newline Getting the text from an element on a page text = self . get_text ( \"header h2\" ) Getting the attribute value from an element on a page attribute = self . get_attribute ( \"#comic img\" , \"title\" ) Asserting existance of an element on a page within some number of seconds: self . wait_for_element_present ( \"div.my_class\" , timeout = 10 ) (NOTE: You can also use: self.assert_element_present(ELEMENT) ) Asserting visibility of an element on a page within some number of seconds: self . wait_for_element_visible ( \"a.my_class\" , timeout = 5 ) (NOTE: The short versions of this are self.find_element(ELEMENT) and self.assert_element(ELEMENT) . The find_element() version returns the element) Since the line above returns the element, you can combine that with .click() as shown below: self . find_element ( \"a.my_class\" , timeout = 5 ) . click () # But you're better off using the following statement, which does the same thing self . click ( \"a.my_class\" ) # DO IT THIS WAY! ProTip\u2122: You can use dots to signify class names (Ex: div.class_name ) as a simplified version of div[class=\"class_name\"] within a CSS selector. You can also use *= to search for any partial value in a CSS selector as shown below: self . click ( 'a[name*=\"partial_name\"]' ) Asserting visibility of text inside an element on a page within some number of seconds: self . assert_text ( \"Make it so!\" , \"div#trek div.picard div.quotes\" ) self . assert_text ( \"Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.\" , \"div#trek div.picard div.quotes\" , timeout = 3 ) (NOTE: self.find_text(TEXT, ELEMENT) and self.wait_for_text(TEXT, ELEMENT) also do this. For backwords compatibility, older method names were kept, but the default timeout may be different.) Asserting Anything self . assert_true ( myvar1 == something ) self . assert_equal ( var1 , var2 ) Useful Conditional Statements (with creative examples in action) is_element_visible(selector) # is an element visible on a page if self . is_element_visible ( 'div#warning' ): print ( \"Red Alert: Something bad might be happening!\" ) is_element_present(selector) # is an element present on a page if self . is_element_present ( 'div#top_secret img.tracking_cookie' ): self . contact_cookie_monster () # Not a real SeleniumBase method else : current_url = self . get_current_url () self . contact_the_nsa ( url = current_url , message = \"Dark Zone Found\" ) # Not a real SeleniumBase method Another example: def is_there_a_cloaked_klingon_ship_on_this_page (): if self . is_element_present ( \"div.ships div.klingon\" ): return not self . is_element_visible ( \"div.ships div.klingon\" ) return False is_text_visible(text, selector) # is text visible on a page def get_mirror_universe_captain_picard_superbowl_ad ( superbowl_year ): selector = \"div.superbowl_ %s div.commercials div.transcript div.picard\" % superbowl_year if self . is_text_visible ( \"For the Love of Marketing and Earl Grey Tea!\" , selector ): return \"Picard HubSpot Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"Delivery Drones... Engage\" , selector ): return \"Picard Amazon Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"Bing it on Screen!\" , selector ): return \"Picard Microsoft Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"OK Glass, Make it So!\" , selector ): return \"Picard Google Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"Number One, I've Never Seen Anything Like It.\" , selector ): return \"Picard Tesla Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"\"\"With the first link, the chain is forged. The first speech censored, the first thought forbidden, the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably.\"\"\" , selector ): return \"Picard Wikimedia Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"Let us make sure history never forgets the name ... Facebook\" , selector ): return \"Picard Facebook Superbowl Ad 2015\" else : raise Exception ( \"Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated.\" ) Switching Tabs What if your test opens up a new tab/window and now you have more than one page? No problem. You need to specify which one you currently want Selenium to use. Switching between tabs/windows is easy: self . switch_to_window ( 1 ) # This switches to the new tab (0 is the first one) ProTip\u2122: iFrames follow the same principle as new windows - you need to specify the iFrame if you want to take action on something in there self . switch_to_frame ( 'ContentManagerTextBody_ifr' ) # Now you can act inside the iFrame # .... Do something cool (here) self . switch_to_default_content () # Exit the iFrame when you're done Handling Pop-Up Alerts What if your test makes an alert pop up in your browser? No problem. You need to switch to it and either accept it or dismiss it: self . wait_for_and_accept_alert () self . wait_for_and_dismiss_alert () If you're not sure whether there's an alert before trying to accept or dismiss it, one way to handle that is to wrap your alert-handling code in a try/except block. Other methods such as .text and .send_keys() will also work with alerts. Executing Custom jQuery Scripts: jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to perform advanced actions in a web browser. If the web page you're on already has jQuery loaded, you can start executing jQuery scripts immediately. You'd know this because the web page would contain something like the following in the HTML: < script src = \"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js\" ></ script > It's OK if you want to use jQuery on a page that doesn't have it loaded yet. To do so, run the following command first: self . activate_jquery () Some websites have a restrictive Content Security Policy to prevent users from loading jQuery and other external libraries onto their websites. If you need to use jQuery or another JS library on such a website, add --disable_csp on the command-line. Here are some examples of using jQuery in your scripts: self . execute_script ( 'jQuery, window.scrollTo(0, 600)' ) # Scrolling the page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('#annoying-widget').hide()\" ) # Hiding elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('#hidden-widget').show(0)\" ) # Showing hidden elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('#annoying-button a').remove()\" ) # Removing elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery(' %s ').mouseover()\" % ( mouse_over_item )) # Mouse-over elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('input#the_id').val('my_text')\" ) # Fast text input on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('div#dropdown a.link').click()\" ) # Click elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"return jQuery('div#amazing')[0].text\" ) # Returns the css \"text\" of the element given self . execute_script ( \"return jQuery('textarea')[2].value\" ) # Returns the css \"value\" of the 3rd textarea element on the page In the following example, JavaScript is used to plant code on a page that Selenium can then touch after that: start_page = \"https://xkcd.com/465/\" destination_page = \"https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase\" self . open ( start_page ) referral_link = '''<a class='analytics test' href=' %s '>Free-Referral Button!</a>''' % destination_page self . execute_script ( '''document.body.innerHTML = \\\" %s \\\" ''' % referral_link ) self . click ( \"a.analytics\" ) # Clicks the generated button (Due to popular demand, this traffic generation example has been baked into SeleniumBase with the self.generate_referral(start_page, end_page) and the self.generate_traffic(start_page, end_page, loops) methods.) Using delayed asserts: Let's say you want to verify multiple different elements on a web page in a single test, but you don't want the test to fail until you verified several elements at once so that you don't have to rerun the test to find more missing elements on the same page. That's where delayed asserts come in. Here's the example: from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_delayed_asserts ( self ): self . open ( 'https://xkcd.com/993/' ) self . wait_for_element ( '#comic' ) self . delayed_assert_element ( 'img[alt=\"Brand Identity\"]' ) self . delayed_assert_element ( 'img[alt=\"Rocket Ship\"]' ) # Will Fail self . delayed_assert_element ( '#comicmap' ) self . delayed_assert_text ( 'Fake Item' , '#middleContainer' ) # Will Fail self . delayed_assert_text ( 'Random' , '#middleContainer' ) self . delayed_assert_element ( 'a[name=\"Super Fake !!!\"]' ) # Will Fail self . process_delayed_asserts () delayed_assert_element() and delayed_assert_text() will save any exceptions that would be raised. To flush out all the failed delayed asserts into a single exception, make sure to call self.process_delayed_asserts() at the end of your test method. If your test hits multiple pages, you can call self.process_delayed_asserts() at the end of all your delayed asserts for a single page. This way, the screenshot from your log file will have the location where the delayed asserts were made. Accessing raw WebDriver If you need access to any commands that come with standard WebDriver, you can call them directly like this: self . driver . delete_all_cookies () capabilities = self . driver . capabilities self . driver . find_elements_by_partial_link_text ( \"GitHub\" ) (In general, you'll want to use the SeleniumBase versions of methods when available.) Retrying failing tests automatically You can use --reruns NUM to retry failing tests that many times. Use --reruns-delay SECONDS to wait that many seconds between retries. Example: pytest --reruns 5 --reruns-delay 1 Additionally, you can use the @retry_on_exception() decorator to specifically retry failing methods.

( Mostly interchangeable. ) cd examples/ pytest my_first_test.py --browser = chrome nosetests my_first_test.py --browser = firefox ( If no browser is specified, Chrome is used by default. ) With Pytest, a green dot means a test passed. An \"F\" means a test failed. Use Demo Mode to help you see what tests are asserting. If the example test is moving too fast for your eyes, you can run it in Demo Mode by adding --demo on the command-line, which pauses the browser briefly between actions, highlights page elements being acted on, and lets you know what test assertions are happening in real time: pytest my_first_test.py --demo Pytest includes test discovery. If you don't specify a specific file or folder to run from, pytest will search all subdirectories automatically for tests to run based on the following matching criteria: Python filenames that start with test_ or end with _test.py . Python methods that start with test_ . The Python class name can be anything since SeleniumBase's BaseCase class inherits from the unittest.TestCase class. You can see which tests are getting discovered by pytest by using: pytest --collect-only -q You can use the following in your scripts to help you debug issues: ( If using ipdb, make sure you add \"-s\" to command-line options unless already in pytest.ini ) import time ; time . sleep ( 5 ) # Makes the test wait and do nothing for 5 seconds. import ipdb ; ipdb . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. import pytest ; pytest . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. To pause an active test that throws an exception or error, add --pdb -s : pytest my_first_test.py --pdb -s The code above will leave your browser window open in case there's a failure. (ipdb commands: 'n', 'c', 's' => next, continue, step). Here are some useful command-line options that come with Pytest: -v # Prints the full test name for each test. -q # Prints fewer details in the console output when running tests. -x # Stop running the tests after the first failure is reached. --html = report.html # Creates a detailed pytest-html report after tests finish. --collect-only # Show what tests would get run without actually running them. -n = NUM # Multithread the tests using that many threads. (Speed up test runs!) -s # See print statements.

Rather than comparing screenshots, layout differences are detected by comparing HTML tags and attributes with a baseline. If a change is detected, it could mean that something broke, the web page was redesigned, or dynamic content changed. To handle automated visual testing, SeleniumBase uses the self.check_window() method, which can set visual baselines for comparison and then compare the latest versions of web pages to the existing baseline. The first time a test calls self.check_window() with a unique \"name\" parameter, the visual baseline is set, which means a folder is created with the following files: * page_url.txt -> The URL of the current window * screenshot.png -> A screenshot of the current window * tags_level1.txt -> HTML tags from the window * tags_level2.txt -> HTML tags + attribute names * tags_level3.txt -> HTML tags + attribute names+values After the first time self.check_window() is called, later calls will compare the HTML tags and attributes of the latest window to the ones from the first call ( or to the ones from the call when the baseline was last reset ). Here's an example call: self.check_window(name=\"first_test)\", level=3) On the first run ( or if the baseline is being set/reset ) the \"level\" doesn't matter because that's only used for comparing the current layout to the existing baseline. Here's how the level system works: * level=0 -> DRY RUN ONLY - Will perform a comparison to the baseline, and print out any differences that are found, but won't fail the test even if differences exist. * level=1 -> HTML tags are compared to tags_level1.txt * level=2 -> HTML tags and attribute names are compared to tags_level2.txt * level=3 -> HTML tags and attribute names+values are compared to tags_level3.txt As shown, Level-3 is the most strict, Level-1 is the least strict. If the comparisons from the latest window to the existing baseline don't match, the current test will fail, except for Level-0 checks, which print Level-3 results without failing the test. You can reset the visual baseline on the command line by adding the following parameter at runtime: --visual_baseline As long as --visual_baseline is used on the command line while running tests, the self.check_window() method cannot fail because it will rebuild the visual baseline rather than comparing the html tags of the latest run to the existing baseline. If there are any expected layout changes to a website that you're testing, you'll need to reset the baseline to prevent unnecessary failures. self.check_window() will fail with \"Page Domain Mismatch Failure\" if the domain of the current URL doesn't match the domain of the baseline URL. If you want to use self.check_window() to compare a web page to a later version of itself in the same test, add the baseline=True parameter to your first self.check_window() call to use that as the baseline.

Rather than comparing screenshots, layout differences are detected by comparing HTML tags and attributes with a baseline. If a change is detected, it could mean that something broke, the web page was redesigned, or dynamic content changed. To handle automated visual testing, SeleniumBase uses the self.check_window() method, which can set visual baselines for comparison and then compare the latest versions of web pages to the existing baseline. The first time a test calls self.check_window() with a unique \"name\" parameter, the visual baseline is set, which means a folder is created with the following files: * page_url.txt -> The URL of the current window * screenshot.png -> A screenshot of the current window * tags_level1.txt -> HTML tags from the window * tags_level2.txt -> HTML tags + attribute names * tags_level3.txt -> HTML tags + attribute names+values After the first time self.check_window() is called, later calls will compare the HTML tags and attributes of the latest window to the ones from the first call ( or to the ones from the call when the baseline was last reset ). Here's an example call: self.check_window(name=\"first_test)\", level=3) On the first run ( or if the baseline is being set/reset ) the \"level\" doesn't matter because that's only used for comparing the current layout to the existing baseline. Here's how the level system works: * level=0 -> DRY RUN ONLY - Will perform a comparison to the baseline, and print out any differences that are found, but won't fail the test even if differences exist. * level=1 -> HTML tags are compared to tags_level1.txt * level=2 -> HTML tags and attribute names are compared to tags_level2.txt * level=3 -> HTML tags and attribute names+values are compared to tags_level3.txt As shown, Level-3 is the most strict, Level-1 is the least strict. If the comparisons from the latest window to the existing baseline don't match, the current test will fail, except for Level-0 checks, which print Level-3 results without failing the test. You can reset the visual baseline on the command line by adding the following parameter at runtime: --visual_baseline As long as --visual_baseline is used on the command line while running tests, the self.check_window() method cannot fail because it will rebuild the visual baseline rather than comparing the html tags of the latest run to the existing baseline. If there are any expected layout changes to a website that you're testing, you'll need to reset the baseline to prevent unnecessary failures. self.check_window() will fail with \"Page Domain Mismatch Failure\" if the domain of the current URL doesn't match the domain of the baseline URL. If you want to use self.check_window() to compare a web page to a later version of itself in the same test, add the baseline=True parameter to your first self.check_window() call to use that as the baseline. ( This only makes sense if you're calling self.check_window() more than once with the same \"name\" parameter in the same test. ) Automated Visual Testing with self.check_window() is not very effective for websites that have dynamic content because that changes the layout and structure of web pages. For those pages, you're much better off using regular SeleniumBase functional testing, unless you can remove the dynamic content before performing the comparison, (such as by using self.ad_block() to remove dynamic ad content on a web page).

If using nosetests , the same applies for setup.cfg .) Here are some useful command-line options that come with Pytest: -v # Prints the full test name for each test. -q # Prints fewer details in the console output when running tests. -x # Stop running the tests after the first failure is reached. --html = report.html # Creates a detailed pytest-html report after tests finish. --collect-only # Show what tests would get run without actually running them. -n = NUM # Multithread the tests using that many threads.

(For more details, see the full list of command-line options here .) Customizing default settings \u00b6 An easy way to override seleniumbase/config/settings.py is by using a custom settings file. Here's the command-line option to add to tests: (See examples/custom_settings.py ) --settings-file=custom_settings.py (Settings include default timeout values, a two-factor auth key, DB credentials, S3 credentials, and other important settings used by tests.) Running tests on a remote Selenium Grid \u00b6 SeleniumBase lets you run tests on remote Selenium Grids such as BrowserStack 's Selenium Grid, Sauce Labs 's Selenium Grid, TestingBot 's Selenium Grid, other Grids, and even your own Grid: (For setting browser desired capabilities while running Selenium remotely, see the ReadMe located here: https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/tree/master/examples/capabilities) Here's how to connect to a BrowserStack Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.browserstack.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a Sauce Labs Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a TestingBot Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.testingbot.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a CrossBrowserTesting Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.crossbrowsertesting.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a LambdaTest Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.lambdatest.com --port = 80 Or you can create your own Selenium Grid for test distribution. ( See this ReadMe for details ) Example tests using Logging \u00b6 pytest test_suite.py --browser = chrome (During test failures, logs and screenshots from the most recent test run will get saved to the latest_logs/ folder. Those logs will get moved to archived_logs/ if you have ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS set to True in settings.py , otherwise log files with be cleaned up at the start of the next test run.) Demo Mode \u00b6 If any test is moving too fast for your eyes to see what's going on, you can run it in Demo Mode by adding --demo on the command line, which pauses the browser briefly between actions, highlights page elements being acted on, and lets you know what test assertions are happening in real time: pytest my_first_test.py --demo You can override the default wait time by either updating settings.py or by using --demo-sleep={NUM} when using Demo Mode. (NOTE: If you use --demo-sleep={NUM} without using --demo , nothing will happen.) pytest my_first_test.py --demo --demo-sleep = 1 .2 Passing additional data to tests \u00b6 If you want to pass additional data from the command line to your tests, you can use --data=STRING . Now inside your tests, you can use self.data to access that. Running tests multithreaded \u00b6 To run Pytest multithreaded on multiple CPUs at the same time, add -n=NUM or -n NUM on the command line, where NUM is the number of CPUs you want to use. Retrying failing tests automatically \u00b6 You can use --reruns=NUM to retry failing tests that many times. Use --reruns-delay=SECONDS to wait that many seconds between retries. Example: pytest --reruns=2 --reruns-delay=1 Debugging tests \u00b6 You can use the following code snippets in your scripts to help you debug issues: import time ; time . sleep ( 5 ) # Makes the test wait and do nothing for 5 seconds. import ipdb ; ipdb . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. import pytest ; pytest . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. To pause an active test that throws an exception or error, add --pdb -s : pytest my_first_test.py --pdb -s The code above will leave your browser window open in case there's a failure. (ipdb commands: 'c', 's', 'n' => continue, step, next). Pytest Reports \u00b6 Using --html=report.html gives you a fancy report of the name specified after your test suite completes. pytest test_suite.py --html = report.html Nosetest Reports \u00b6 The --report option gives you a fancy report after your test suite completes. nosetests test_suite.py --report (NOTE: You can add --show_report to immediately display Nosetest reports after the test suite completes. Only use --show_report when running tests locally because it pauses the test run.) Using a Proxy Server \u00b6 If you wish to use a proxy server for your browser tests (Chrome and Firefox only), you can add --proxy=IP_ADDRESS:PORT as an argument on the command line. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = IP_ADDRESS:PORT If the proxy server that you wish to use requires authentication, you can do the following (Chrome only): pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_ADDRESS:PORT To make things easier, you can add your frequently-used proxies to PROXY_LIST in proxy_list.py , and then use --proxy=KEY_FROM_PROXY_LIST to use the IP_ADDRESS:PORT of that key. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = proxy1 Changing the User-Agent \u00b6 If you wish to change the User-Agent for your browser tests (Chrome and Firefox only), you can add --agent=\"USER-AGENT-STRING\" as an argument on the command line. pytest user_agent_test.py --agent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo 3DS; U; ; en) Version/1.7412.EU\" Mobile Device Testing \u00b6 Use --mobile to quickly run your tests using Chrome's mobile device emulator with default values for device metrics (CSS Width, CSS Height, Pixel-Ratio) and a default value set for the user agent. To configure the mobile device metrics, use --metrics=\"CSS_Width,CSS_Height,Pixel_Ratio\" to set those values. You'll also be able to set the user agent with --agent=\"USER-AGENT-STRING\" (a default user agent will be used if not specified). To find real values for device metrics, see this GitHub Gist . For a list of available user agent strings, check out this page . # Run tests using Chrome's mobile device emulator (default settings) pytest test_swag_labs.py --mobile # Run mobile tests specifying CSS Width, CSS Height, and Pixel-Ratio pytest test_swag_labs.py --mobile --metrics = \"411,731,3\" # Run mobile tests specifying the user agent pytest test_swag_labs.py --mobile --agent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Linux; Android 9; Pixel 3 XL)\"","title":"CMD Options"},{"location":"help_docs/customizing_test_runs/#customizing-default-settings","text":"An easy way to override seleniumbase/config/settings.py is by using a custom settings file.

Sample run commands may look like this when run from the SeleniumBase/examples/ folder: (The browser is now specified in the capabilities file.) pytest my_first_test.py --browser = remote --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.browserstack.com --port = 80 --cap_file = capabilities/sample_cap_file_BS.py pytest my_first_test.py --browser = remote --server = USERNAME:KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com --port = 80 --cap_file = capabilities/sample_cap_file_SL.py (Parameters: --browser=remote , --server=SERVER , --port=PORT , and --cap_file=CAP_FILE.py ) Here's an example desired capabilities file for BrowserStack: desired_cap = { 'os' : 'OS X' , 'os_version' : 'High Sierra' , 'browser' : 'Chrome' , 'browser_version' : '77.0' , 'browserstack.local' : 'false' , 'browserstack.selenium_version' : '3.141.59' } Here's an example desired capabilities file for Sauce Labs: capabilities = { 'browserName' : 'firefox' , 'browserVersion' : '70.0' , 'platformName' : 'macOS 10.13' , 'sauce:options' : { } } (You'll notice that the browser is now being specified in the capabilities file, rather than with --browser=BROWSER ) You can generate specific desired capabilities using: BrowserStack desired capabilities Sauce Labs desired capabilities TestingBot desired capabilities Parsing desired capabilities: SeleniumBase has a desired capabilities parser that can capture all lines from the specified file in the following formats: 'KEY': 'VALUE' 'KEY': True 'KEY': False caps['KEY'] = \"VALUE\" caps['KEY'] = True caps['KEY'] = False (Each pair must be on a separate line. You can interchange single and double quotes.) You can also swap --browser=remote with an actual browser, eg --browser=chrome , which will combine the default SeleniumBase desired capabilities with those that were specified in the capabilities file when using --cap_file=FILE.py . Capabilities will override other parameters, so if you set the browser to one thing and the capabilities browser to another, SeleniumBase will use the capabilities browser as the browser. You'll need default SeleniumBase capabilities for: * Using a proxy server (not the same as a Selenium Grid server) * Downloading files to a desired folder * Disabling some warnings on Chrome * Overriding a website's Content Security Policy on Chrome * Other possible reasons You can also set browser desired capabilities from a command line string: Example: pytest test_swag_labs.py --cap-string = '{\"browserName\":\"chrome\",\"name\":\"test1\"}' --server = \"127.0.0.1\" --browser = remote (Enclose cap-string in single quotes. Enclose parameter keys in double quotes.) If you pass \"*\" into the \"name\" field of --cap-string , the name will become the test identifier. Example: pytest test_swag_labs.py --cap-string = '{\"browserName\":\"chrome\",\"name\":\"*\"}' --server = \"127.0.0.1\" --browser = chrome Example name: \"my_first_test.MyTestClass.test_basic\" Using a local Selenium Grid If using a local Selenium Grid with SeleniumBase, start up the Grid Hub and nodes first: seleniumbase grid-hub start seleniumbase grid-node start (The Selenium Server JAR file will be automatically downloaded for first-time Grid users.

Method calls and `` import `` lines get swapped . Both a language and an action must be specified . The `` - p `` action can be paired with one other action . When running with `` - c `` ( or `` --copy``) the new file name will be the orginal name appended with an underscore plus the 2 - letter language code of the new language .

Fork the SeleniumBase repo on GitHub to get started quickly. \u00b6 (You'll be using your own repository eventually.) Step 1. Find Jenkins in the Azure Marketplace \u00b6 Search for \"Jenkins\" in the Azure Marketplace and select the Jenkins (Publisher: Microsoft) result to get to the Jenkins Start page. \u00b6 Step 2. Launch a Jenkins instance \u00b6 Click \"Create\" and follow the steps... \u00b6 Continue to \"Additional Settings\" when you're done with \"Basics\". \u00b6 On the \"Additional Settings\" section, set the Size to \"B2s\": \u00b6 Once you've reached Step 5, click \"Create\" to complete the setup. \u00b6 Step 3. Inspect your new Jenkins instance to SSH into the new machine \u00b6 Once your new Jenkins instance has finished launching, you should be able to see the main page \u00b6 On the main page, you should be able to find the Public IP Address. \u00b6 Use that IP Address to SSH into the machine: ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS Step 4. Clone the SeleniumBase repository from the root (\"/\") directory. \u00b6 cd / sudo git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git Step 5. Enter the \"linux\" folder \u00b6 cd SeleniumBase/integrations/linux/ Step 6. Give the \"jenkins\" user sudo access (See jenkins_permissions.sh for details) \u00b6 ./jenkins_permissions.sh Step 7. Become the \"jenkins\" user and enter a \"bash\" shell \u00b6 sudo su jenkins bash Step 8. Install dependencies (See Linuxfile.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Linuxfile.sh Step 9. Start up the headless browser display mechanism: Xvfb (See Xvfb_launcher.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Xvfb_launcher.sh Step 10. Go to the SeleniumBase directory \u00b6 cd /SeleniumBase Step 11. Install the requirements for SeleniumBase \u00b6 sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade Step 12. Install SeleniumBase (Make sure you already installed the requirements above) \u00b6 sudo python setup.py develop Step 13. Install chromedriver \u00b6 sudo seleniumbase install chromedriver Step 14. Run an example test in Chrome to verify installation (May take up to 10 seconds) \u00b6 pytest examples/my_first_test.py --headless --browser = chrome Step 15. Secure your Jenkins machine \u00b6 Navigate to http://JENKINS_IP_ADDRESS/jenkins-on-azure/ \u00b6 (Depending on your version of Jenkins, you may see the following screen, or nothing at all.) Initially, Jenkins uses only http , which makes it less secure. \u00b6 You'll need to set up SSH Port Forwarding in order to secure it. \u00b6 To do this, copy/paste the string and run it in a NEW command prompt on your local machine (NOT from an SSH terminal session), swapping out the username and DNS name with the ones you set up when creating the Jenkins instance in Azure. ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:8080 USERNAME@DNS_NAME Step 16. Login to Jenkins \u00b6 If you've correctly set up SSH Port Forwarding, the url will be http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \u00b6 You'll need to get the password from the SSH terminal on the Linux machine to log in \u00b6 sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword Step 17. Customize Jenkins \u00b6 Step 18. Create an Admin user \u00b6 Once Jenkins has finished loading, the top left of the page should look like this \u00b6 Step 19. Create a new Jenkins job \u00b6 Click on \"New Item\" Give your new Jenkins job a name (ex: \"Test1\") Select \"Freestyle project\" Click \"OK\" Step 20. Setup your new Jenkins job \u00b6 Under \"Source Code Management\", select \"Git\". For the \"Repository URL\", put: https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git . (You'll eventually be using your own clone of the repository here.) Under \"Build\", click the \"Add build step\" dropdown. Select \"Execute shell\". For the \"Command\", paste: cd examples pytest my_first_test.py --headless Click \"Save\" when you're done. \u00b6 You'll see the following page after that: Step 21. Run your new Jenkins job \u00b6 Click on \"Build Now\" (If everything was done correctly, you'll see a blue dot appear after a few seconds, indicating that the test job passed.) Step 22. See the top Jenkins page for an overview of all jobs \u00b6 Step 23. Future Work \u00b6 If you have a web application that you want to test, you'll be able to create SeleniumBase tests and add them to Jenkins as you saw here. You may want to create a Deploy job, which downloads the latest version of your repository, and then kicks off all tests to run after that. You could then tell that Deploy job to auto-run whenever a change is pushed to your repository by using: \"Poll SCM\". All your tests would then be able to run by using: \"Build after other projects are built\". Congratulations!

Open the Google Cloud Platform Cloud Launcher \u00b6 Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher (If you already have an active Google Cloud project, the Google Cloud Launcher will probably default to using that. If you don't, sign up for the free trial of Google Cloud Platform here to get started.) Step 2. Launch a Jenkins instance \u00b6 Under \"Cloud Launcher\", Click on \"Jenkins Certified by Bitnami\" Click on \"Launch on Compute Engine\" Give the instance a name Give the instance a zone Click \"Create\" Step 3. Connect with your new Jenkins instance \u00b6 SSH into your new instance by selecting: \"SSH\" => \"Open in browser window\" from the instance page. Step 4. Clone the SeleniumBase repository from the root (\"/\") directory. \u00b6 cd / sudo git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git Step 5. Enter the \"linux\" folder \u00b6 cd SeleniumBase/integrations/linux/ Step 6.

Become \"tomcat\" (the Jenkins user) and enter a \"bash\" shell \u00b6 sudo su tomcat bash Step 8. Install dependencies (See Linuxfile.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Linuxfile.sh Step 9. Start up the headless browser display mechanism: Xvfb (See Xvfb_launcher.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Xvfb_launcher.sh Step 10. Go to the SeleniumBase directory \u00b6 cd /SeleniumBase Step 11. Install the requirements for SeleniumBase \u00b6 sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade Step 12. Install SeleniumBase (Make sure you already installed the requirements above) \u00b6 sudo python setup.py develop Step 13.

You may want to create a Deploy job, which downloads the latest version of your repository, and then kicks off all tests to run after that. You could then tell that Deploy job to auto-run whenever a change is pushed to your repository by using: \"Poll SCM\". All your tests would then be able to run by using: \"Build after other projects are built\". You can also use MySQL to save test results in the DB so that you can query the data at any time.

Return to the Google Cloud Launcher and launch a MySQL Instance \u00b6 Under \"Featured Solutions\", Click on \"MySQL\" Click on \"Launch on Compute Engine\" Give the instance a name Give the instance a zone Click \"Create\" Step 22. Get the Connection credentials for your new MySQL Instance \u00b6 Under the Google Cloud Platform menu, go to \"Compute Engine\" Find your new MySQL instance and then write down the value written in the \"External IP\" section. Under the Google Cloud Platform menu, go to \"Deployment Manager\" Find your new MySQL instance and then click on it. Write down the values for Admin username and password. (Username should be \"root\") Step 23. Get a MySQL GUI tool so that you can connect to your MySQL Instance \u00b6 You can download MySQL Workbench for this. Step 24. Create a new connection to your MySQL Instance \u00b6 Use the MySQL DB credentials that you saved in Step 21 for this. Step 25. Create a new database/schema in your MySQL Instance \u00b6 You can name your database/schema test_db . Step 26. Create the necessary tables in your MySQL database/schema \u00b6 Run the create_db_tables.sql script in your MySQL database/schema to create all the required DB tables. Step 27. Have your local clone of SeleniumBase connect to your MySQL DB Instance \u00b6 Update the MySQL connection details in your settings.py file to use the credentials that you saved in Step 21. Step 28.

This generally means storing passwords in plaintext formats. For security reasons, that may not be an optimal solution. For this reason, encryption/obfuscation tools have been built here to help you mask your passwords in your tests. It's not a bulletproof solution, but it can keep anyone looking over your shoulder during test creation from getting your login passwords if they don't have your encryption key, which is stored in a separate file. Usage \u00b6 First, set your custom encryption/decryption key in your local clone of settings.py . (If you modify the key later, you'll need to encrypt all your passwords again.) Next, use obfuscate.py to obfuscate/encrypt passwords into coded strings: python obfuscate.py Enter password to obfuscate: ( CTRL-C to exit ) Password: ********* Verify password: Password: ********* Here is the obfuscated password: $^*ENCRYPT = RXlYMSJWTz8HSwM = ? & #$ (You can also use unobfuscate.py to encrypt passwords without having them masked while typing them. Or you can use it to decrypt an obfuscated pasword.) Finally, in your tests you can now decrypt obfuscated passwords for use in login methods like this: from seleniumbase import encryption ... password = encryption . decrypt ( '$^*ENCRYPT=RXlYMSJWTz8HSwM=?&#$' ) (You'll notice that encrypted strings have a common start token and end token.

Type seleniumbase on the command line to use console scripts. ( For running tests, use pytest with SeleniumBase . ) install \u00b6 Usage: seleniumbase install [DRIVER_NAME] (Drivers: chromedriver , geckodriver , edgedriver , iedriver , operadriver ) Example: seleniumbase install chromedriver Output: Installs the specified webdriver. ( chromedriver is required for Google Chrome automation) ( geckodriver is required for Mozilla Firefox automation) ( edgedriver is required for Microsoft Edge automation) ( iedriver is required for Internet Explorer automation) ( operadriver is required for Opera Browser automation) mkdir \u00b6 Usage: seleniumbase mkdir [DIRECTORY_NAME] Example: seleniumbase mkdir browser_tests Output: Creates a new folder for running SeleniumBase scripts. The new folder contains default config files, sample tests for helping new users get started, and Python boilerplates for setting up customized test frameworks. convert \u00b6 Usage: seleniumbase convert [PYTHON_WEBDRIVER_UNITTEST_FILE] Output: Converts a Selenium IDE exported WebDriver unittest file into a SeleniumBase file. Adds _SB to the new file name while keeping the original file intact. Works with Katalon Recorder scripts.
