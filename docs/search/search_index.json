Example: my_first_test.py ( --demo mode) pytest my_first_test.py --demo Python Setup: \ud83d\udd35 Add Python and Git to your System PATH. \ud83d\udd35 Create a Python virtual environment . Install SeleniumBase: \ud83d\udd35 You can install seleniumbase from GitHub : git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git cd SeleniumBase/ pip install . # Normal installation pip install -e . # Editable install (When using a virtual env, the Editable install is faster.) \ud83d\udd35 You can also install seleniumbase from pypi : pip install seleniumbase (Add --upgrade OR -U to upgrade an installation.) (Add --force-reinstall to upgrade dependencies.) (Use pip3 if multiple versions of Python are installed.) \ud83d\udd35 Type seleniumbase or sbase to verify that SeleniumBase was installed successfully: ______ __ _ ____ / ____/__ / /__ ____ ( _ ) _ ______ ___ / _ \\_ ___ ________ \\_ _ \\/ _ \\/ / _ \\/ __ \\/ / / / / __ ` __ \\/ /_ ) / __ \\/ ___/ _ \\ ___/ / __/ / __/ / / / / /_/ / / / / / / /_ ) / ( _/ /__ / __/ /____/ \\_ __/_/ \\_ __/_/ /_/_/ \\_ _,_/_/ /_/ /_/_____/ \\_ _,_/____/ \\_ __/ ----------------------------------------------------------------- * USAGE: \"seleniumbase [COMMAND] [PARAMETERS]\" * OR: \"sbase [COMMAND] [PARAMETERS]\" COMMANDS: install [ DRIVER ] [ OPTIONS ] methods ( List common Python methods ) options ( List common pytest options ) mkdir [ DIRECTORY ] [ OPTIONS ] mkfile [ FILE.py ] [ OPTIONS ] mkpres [ FILE.py ] [ LANG ] print [ FILE ] [ OPTIONS ] translate [ SB_FILE.py ] [ LANG ] [ ACTION ] convert [ WEBDRIVER_UNITTEST_FILE.py ] extract-objects [ SB_FILE.py ] inject-objects [ SB_FILE.py ] [ OPTIONS ] objectify [ SB_FILE.py ] [ OPTIONS ] revert-objects [ SB_FILE.py ] [ OPTIONS ] encrypt ( OR: obfuscate ) decrypt ( OR: unobfuscate ) download server ( The Selenium Grid JAR file ) grid-hub [ start | stop ] [ OPTIONS ] grid-node [ start | stop ] --hub =[ HOST/IP ] * ( EXAMPLE: \"sbase install chromedriver latest\" ) * Type \"sbase help [COMMAND]\" for specific command info. For info on all commands, type: \"seleniumbase --help\" . * ( Use \"pytest\" for running tests ) * Download a webdriver: \u2705 SeleniumBase can download webdrivers to the seleniumbase/drivers folder with the install command: sbase install chromedriver You need a different webdriver for each browser to automate: chromedriver for Chrome, edgedriver for Edge, geckodriver for Firefox, and operadriver for Opera. If you have the latest version of Chrome installed, get the latest chromedriver ( otherwise it defaults to chromedriver 2.44 for compatibility reasons ): sbase install chromedriver latest If you run a test without the correct webdriver installed, the driver will be downloaded automatically. (See seleniumbase.io/seleniumbase/console_scripts/ReadMe/ for more information on SeleniumBase console scripts.) Running tests: \ud83d\udd35 If you've cloned SeleniumBase from GitHub, you can run sample tests from the examples/ folder: cd examples/ pytest test_demo_site.py (Chrome is the default browser if not specified with --browser=BROWSER . On Linux, --headless is the default behavior. You can also run in headless mode on any OS. If your Linux machine has a GUI and you want to see the web browser as tests run, add --headed or --gui .) \ud83d\udd35 Here are more examples that you can run: pytest my_first_test.py pytest test_swag_labs.py \ud83d\udd35 Run my_first_test.py in Demo Mode: pytest my_first_test.py --demo Here's the code for my_first_test.py : from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_basics ( self ): url = \"https://store.xkcd.com/collections/posters\" self . open ( url ) self . type ( 'input[name=\"q\"]' , \"xkcd book\" ) self . click ( 'input[value=\"Search\"]' ) self . assert_text ( \"xkcd: volume 0\" , \"h3\" ) self . open ( \"https://xkcd.com/353/\" ) self . assert_title ( \"xkcd: Python\" ) self . assert_element ( 'img[alt=\"Python\"]' ) self . click ( 'a[rel=\"license\"]' ) self . assert_text ( \"free to copy and reuse\" ) self . go_back () self . click_link ( \"About\" ) self . assert_exact_text ( \"xkcd.com\" , \"h2\" ) By default, CSS Selectors are used for finding page elements. If you're new to CSS Selectors, games like Flukeout can help you learn. Here are some common SeleniumBase methods you might find in tests: self . open ( URL ) # Navigate to the web page self . click ( SELECTOR ) # Click a page element self . type ( SELECTOR , TEXT ) # Type text (Add \"\\n\" to text for pressing enter/return.) self . assert_element ( SELECTOR ) # Assert element is visible self . assert_text ( TEXT ) # Assert text is visible (has optional SELECTOR arg) self . assert_title ( PAGE_TITLE ) # Assert page title self . assert_no_404_errors () # Assert no 404 errors from files on the page self . assert_no_js_errors () # Assert no JavaScript errors on the page (Chrome-ONLY) self . execute_script ( JAVASCRIPT ) # Execute JavaScript code self . go_back () # Navigate to the previous URL self . get_text ( SELECTOR ) # Get text from a selector self . get_attribute ( SELECTOR , ATTRIBUTE ) # Get a specific attribute from a selector self . is_element_visible ( SELECTOR ) # Determine if an element is visible on the page self . is_text_visible ( TEXT ) # Determine if text is visible on the page (optional SELECTOR) self . hover_and_click ( HOVER_SELECTOR , CLICK_SELECTOR ) # Mouseover element & click another self . select_option_by_text ( DROPDOWN_SELECTOR , OPTION_TEXT ) # Select a dropdown option self . switch_to_frame ( FRAME_NAME ) # Switch webdriver control to an iframe on the page self . switch_to_default_content () # Switch webdriver control out of the current iframe self . switch_to_window ( WINDOW_NUMBER ) # Switch to a different window/tab self . save_screenshot ( FILE_NAME ) # Save a screenshot of the current page \ud83d\udd35 For the complete list of SeleniumBase methods, see: Method Summary Learn More: \u2705 Automatic WebDriver Abilities: SeleniumBase automatically handles common WebDriver actions such as spinning up web browsers and saving screenshots during test failures. ( Read more about customizing test runs . ) \u2705 Simplified Code: SeleniumBase uses simple syntax for commands. Example: self . type ( \"input\" , \"dogs \\n \" ) SeleniumBase tests can be run with both pytest and nosetests , but using pytest is recommended. ( chrome is the default browser if not specified.) pytest my_first_test.py --browser = chrome nosetests test_suite.py --browser = firefox \u2705 Automatic Test Discovery: All Python methods that start with test_ will automatically be run when using pytest or nosetests on a Python file, ( or on folders containing Python files ). You can also be more specific on what to run within a file by using the following: ( Note that the syntax is different for pytest vs nosetests. ) pytest [ FILE_NAME.py ] :: [ CLASS_NAME ] :: [ METHOD_NAME ] nosetests [ FILE_NAME.py ] : [ CLASS_NAME ] . [ METHOD_NAME ] \u2705 No More Flaky Tests: SeleniumBase methods automatically wait for page elements to finish loading before interacting with them ( up to a timeout limit ). This means you no longer need random time.sleep() statements in your scripts. \u2705 Automated/Manual Hybrid Mode: SeleniumBase includes a solution called MasterQA , which speeds up manual testing by having automation perform all the browser actions while the manual tester handles validation. \u2705 Feature-Rich: For a full list of SeleniumBase features, Click Here . Detailed Instructions: Use Demo Mode to help you see what tests are asserting. \ud83d\udd35 If the example test is moving too fast for your eyes, you can run it in Demo Mode by adding --demo on the command-line, which pauses the browser briefly between actions, highlights page elements being acted on, and lets you know what test assertions are happening in real time: pytest my_first_test.py --demo \ud83d\udd35 Pytest includes test discovery. If you don't specify a specific file or folder to run from, pytest will search all subdirectories automatically for tests to run based on the following matching criteria: Python filenames that start with test_ or end with _test.py . Python methods that start with test_ . The Python class name can be anything since SeleniumBase's BaseCase class inherits from the unittest.TestCase class. You can see which tests are getting discovered by pytest by using: pytest --collect-only -q \ud83d\udd35 You can use the following calls in your scripts to help you debug issues: import time ; time . sleep ( 5 ) # Makes the test wait and do nothing for 5 seconds. import ipdb ; ipdb . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. import pytest ; pytest . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. \ud83d\udd35 To pause an active test that throws an exception or error, add --pdb : pytest my_first_test.py --pdb The code above will leave your browser window open in case there's a failure. (ipdb commands: 'n', 'c', 's' => next, continue, step). \ud83d\udd35 Here are some useful command-line options that come with pytest : -v # Verbose mode. Prints the full name of each test run. -q # Quiet mode. Print fewer details in the console output when running tests. -x # Stop running the tests after the first failure is reached. --html = report.html # Creates a detailed pytest-html report after tests finish. --collect-only | --co # Show what tests would get run. (Without running them) -n = NUM # Multithread the tests using that many threads. (Speed up test runs!) -s # See print statements. (Should be on by default with pytest.ini present.) --junit-xml = report.xml # Creates a junit-xml report after tests finish. --pdb # If a test fails, pause run and enter debug mode. (Don't use with CI!) -m = MARKER # Run tests with the specified pytest marker. \ud83d\udd35 SeleniumBase provides additional pytest command-line options for tests: --browser = BROWSER # (The web browser to use. Default: \"chrome\".) --chrome # (Shortcut for \"--browser=chrome\". On by default.) --edge # (Shortcut for \"--browser=edge\".) --firefox # (Shortcut for \"--browser=firefox\".) --opera # (Shortcut for \"--browser=opera\".) --safari # (Shortcut for \"--browser=safari\".) --cap-file = FILE # (The web browser's desired capabilities to use.) --cap-string = STRING # (The web browser's desired capabilities to use.) --settings-file = FILE # (Override default SeleniumBase settings.) --env = ENV # (Set a test environment. Use \"self.env\" to use this in tests.) --data = DATA # (Extra test data. Access with \"self.data\" in tests.) --var1 = DATA # (Extra test data. Access with \"self.var1\" in tests.) --var2 = DATA # (Extra test data. Access with \"self.var2\" in tests.) --var3 = DATA # (Extra test data. Access with \"self.var3\" in tests.) --user-data-dir = DIR # (Set the Chrome user data directory to use.) --server = SERVER # (The Selenium Grid server/IP used for tests.) --port = PORT # (The Selenium Grid port used by the test server.) --proxy = SERVER:PORT # (Connect to a proxy server:port for tests.) --proxy = USERNAME:PASSWORD@SERVER:PORT # (Use authenticated proxy server.) --agent = STRING # (Modify the web browser's User-Agent string.) --mobile # (Use the mobile device emulator while running tests.) --metrics = STRING # (Set mobile metrics: \"CSSWidth,CSSHeight,PixelRatio\".) --extension-zip = ZIP # (Load a Chrome Extension .zip|.crx, comma-separated.) --extension-dir = DIR # (Load a Chrome Extension directory, comma-separated.) --headless # (Run tests headlessly. Default mode on Linux OS.) --headed # (Run tests with a GUI on Linux OS.) --locale = LOCALE_CODE # (Set the Language Locale Code for the web browser.) --interval = SECONDS # (The autoplay interval for presentations & tour steps) --start-page = URL # (The starting URL for the web browser when tests begin.) --archive-logs # (Archive existing log files instead of deleting them.) --archive-downloads # (Archive old downloads instead of deleting them.) --time-limit = SECONDS # (Safely fail any test that exceeds the time limit.) --slow # (Slow down the automation. Faster than using Demo Mode.) --demo # (Slow down and visually see test actions as they occur.) --demo-sleep = SECONDS # (Set the wait time after Demo Mode actions.) --highlights = NUM # (Number of highlight animations for Demo Mode actions.) --message-duration = SECONDS # (The time length for Messenger alerts.) --check-js # (Check for JavaScript errors after page loads.) --ad-block # (Block some types of display ads after page loads.) --block-images # (Block images from loading during tests.) --verify-delay = SECONDS # (The delay before MasterQA verification checks.) --disable-csp # (Disable the Content Security Policy of websites.) --disable-ws # (Disable Web Security on Chromium-based browsers.) --enable-ws # (Enable Web Security on Chromium-based browsers.) --enable-sync # (Enable \"Chrome Sync\".) --use-auto-ext # (Use Chrome's automation extension.) --remote-debug # (Enable Chrome's Remote Debugger on http://localhost:9222) --dashboard # (Enable the SeleniumBase Dashboard. Saved at: dashboard.html) --swiftshader # (Use Chrome's \"--use-gl=swiftshader\" feature.) --incognito # (Enable Chrome's Incognito mode.) --guest # (Enable Chrome's Guest mode.) --devtools # (Open Chrome's DevTools when the browser opens.) --reuse-session | --rs # (Reuse browser session between tests.) --crumbs # (Delete all cookies between tests reusing a session.) --maximize-window # (Start tests with the web browser window maximized.) --save-screenshot # (Save a screenshot at the end of each test.) --visual-baseline # (Set the visual baseline for Visual/Layout tests.) --timeout-multiplier = MULTIPLIER # (Multiplies the default timeout values.) (For more details, see the full list of command-line options here .) \ud83d\udd35 During test failures, logs and screenshots from the most recent test run will get saved to the latest_logs/ folder. Those logs will get moved to archived_logs/ if you add --archive_logs to command-line options, or have ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS set to True in settings.py , otherwise log files with be cleaned up at the start of the next test run. The test_suite.py collection contains tests that fail on purpose so that you can see how logging works. cd examples/ pytest test_suite.py --browser = chrome pytest test_suite.py --browser = firefox An easy way to override seleniumbase/config/settings.py is by using a custom settings file. Here's the command-line option to add to tests: (See examples/custom_settings.py ) --settings_file=custom_settings.py (Settings include default timeout values, a two-factor auth key, DB credentials, S3 credentials, and other important settings used by tests.) \ud83d\udd35 To pass additional data from the command-line to tests, add --data=\"ANY STRING\" . Inside your tests, you can use self.data to access that. Test Directory Configuration: \ud83d\udd35 When running tests with pytest , you'll want a copy of pytest.ini in your root folders. When running tests with nosetests , you'll want a copy of setup.cfg in your root folders. These files specify default configuration details for tests. Folders should also include a blank __init__.py file, which allows your tests to import files from that folder. \ud83d\udd35 sbase mkdir DIR creates a folder with config files and sample tests: sbase mkdir ui_tests That new folder will have these files: ui_tests/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 boilerplates/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 base_test_case.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 boilerplate_test.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 classic_obj_test.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 page_objects.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 samples/ \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u2502 \u251c\u2500\u2500 google_objects.py \u2502 \u2514\u2500\u2500 google_test.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 my_first_test.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 parameterized_test.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 pytest.ini \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt \u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.cfg \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_demo_site.py ProTip\u2122: You can also create a boilerplate folder without any sample tests in it by adding -b or --basic to the sbase mkdir command: sbase mkdir ui_tests --basic That new folder will have these files: ui_tests/ \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py \u251c\u2500\u2500 pytest.ini \u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt \u2514\u2500\u2500 setup.cfg Of those files, the pytest.ini config file is the most important, followed by a blank __init__.py file. There's also a setup.cfg file (only needed for nosetests). Finally, the requirements.txt file can be used to help you install seleniumbase into your environments (if it's not already installed). Log files from failed tests: Let's try an example of a test that fails: \"\"\" test_fail.py \"\"\" from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_find_army_of_robots_on_xkcd_desert_island ( self ): self . open ( \"https://xkcd.com/731/\" ) self . assert_element ( \"div#ARMY_OF_ROBOTS\" , timeout = 1 ) # This should fail You can run it from the examples/ folder like this: pytest test_fail.py \ud83d\udd35 You'll notice that a logs folder, \"latest_logs\", was created to hold information about the failing test, and screenshots. During test runs, past results get moved to the archived_logs folder if you have ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS set to True in settings.py , or if your run tests with --archive-logs . If you choose not to archive existing logs, they will be deleted and replaced by the logs of the latest test run. The SeleniumBase Dashboard: \ud83d\udd35 The --dashboard option for pytest generates a SeleniumBase Dashboard located at dashboard.html , which updates automatically as tests run and produce results. Example: pytest --dashboard --rs --headless \ud83d\udd35 Additionally, you can host your own SeleniumBase Dashboard Server on a port of your choice. Here's an example of that using Python 3's http.server : python -m http.server 1948 \ud83d\udd35 Now you can navigate to http://localhost:1948/dashboard.html in order to view the dashboard as a web app. This requires two different terminal windows: one for running the server, and another for running the tests, which should be run from the same directory. (Use CTRL+C to stop the http server.) \ud83d\udd35 Here's a full example of what the SeleniumBase Dashboard may look like: pytest test_suite.py --dashboard --rs --headless Creating Visual Test Reports: Pytest Reports: \ud83d\udd35 Using --html=report.html gives you a fancy report of the name specified after your test suite completes. pytest test_suite.py --html = report.html \ud83d\udd35 When combining pytest html reports with SeleniumBase Dashboard usage, the pie chart from the Dashboard will get added to the html report. Additionally, if you set the html report URL to be the same as the Dashboard URL when also using the dashboard, (example: --dashboard --html=dashboard.html ), then the Dashboard will become an advanced html report when all the tests complete. \ud83d\udd35 Here's an example of an upgraded html report: pytest test_suite.py --dashboard --html = report.html If viewing pytest html reports in Jenkins , you may need to configure Jenkins settings for the html to render correctly. This is due to Jenkins CSP changes . You can also use --junit-xml=report.xml to get an xml report instead. Jenkins can use this file to display better reporting for your tests. pytest test_suite.py --junit-xml = report.xml Nosetest Reports: The --report option gives you a fancy report after your test suite completes. nosetests test_suite.py --report (NOTE: You can add --show-report to immediately display Nosetest reports after the test suite completes. Only use --show-report when running tests locally because it pauses the test run.) Allure Reports: See: https://docs.qameta.io/allure/ SeleniumBase no longer includes allure-pytest as part of installed dependencies. If you want to use it, install it first: pip install allure-pytest Now your tests can create Allure results files, which can be processed by Allure Reports. pytest test_suite.py --alluredir = allure_results Using a Proxy Server: If you wish to use a proxy server for your browser tests (Chromium or Firefox), you can add --proxy=IP_ADDRESS:PORT as an argument on the command line. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = IP_ADDRESS:PORT If the proxy server that you wish to use requires authentication, you can do the following (Chromium only): pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_ADDRESS:PORT SeleniumBase also supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies: pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = \"socks4://IP_ADDRESS:PORT\" pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = \"socks5://IP_ADDRESS:PORT\" To make things easier, you can add your frequently-used proxies to PROXY_LIST in proxy_list.py , and then use --proxy=KEY_FROM_PROXY_LIST to use the IP_ADDRESS:PORT of that key. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = proxy1 Changing the User-Agent: \ud83d\udd35 If you wish to change the User-Agent for your browser tests (Chromium and Firefox only), you can add --agent=\"USER AGENT STRING\" as an argument on the command-line. pytest user_agent_test.py --agent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo 3DS; U; ; en) Version/1.7412.EU\" Building Guided Tours for Websites: \ud83d\udd35 Learn about SeleniumBase Interactive Walkthroughs (in the examples/tour_examples/ folder). It's great for prototyping a website onboarding experience. Production Environments & Integrations: \ud83d\udd35 Here are some things you can do to set up a production environment for your testing: You can set up a Jenkins build server for running tests at regular intervals. For a real-world Jenkins example of headless browser automation in action, check out the SeleniumBase Jenkins example on Azure or the SeleniumBase Jenkins example on Google Cloud . You can use the Selenium Grid to scale your testing by distributing tests on several machines with parallel execution. To do this, check out the SeleniumBase selenium_grid folder , which should have everything you need, including the Selenium Grid ReadMe , which will help you get started. If you're using the SeleniumBase MySQL feature to save results from tests running on a server machine, you can install MySQL Workbench to help you read & write from your DB more easily. If you use Slack , you can easily have your Jenkins jobs display results there by using the Jenkins Slack Plugin . Another way to send messages from your tests to Slack is by using Slack's Incoming Webhooks API . If you're using AWS, you can set up an Amazon S3 account for saving log files and screenshots from your tests. To activate this feature, modify settings.py with connection details in the S3 section, and add \" --with-s3-logging \" on the command-line when running your tests. Here's an example of running tests with additional features enabled: pytest [ YOUR_TEST_FILE.py ] --with-db-reporting --with-s3-logging Detailed Method Specifications and Examples: \ud83d\udd35 Navigating to a web page: (and related commands) self . open ( \"https://xkcd.com/378/\" ) # This method opens the specified page. self . go_back () # This method navigates the browser to the previous page. self . go_forward () # This method navigates the browser forward in history. self . refresh_page () # This method reloads the current page. self . get_current_url () # This method returns the current page URL. self . get_page_source () # This method returns the current page source. ProTip\u2122: You may need to use the self.get_page_source() method along with Python's find() command to parse through the source to find something that Selenium wouldn't be able to. (You may want to brush up on your Python programming skills for that.) source = self . get_page_source () head_open_tag = source . find ( '<head>' ) head_close_tag = source . find ( '</head>' , head_open_tag ) everything_inside_head = source [ head_open_tag + len ( '<head>' ): head_close_tag ] \ud83d\udd35 Clicking: To click an element on the page: self . click ( \"div#my_id\" ) ProTip\u2122: In most web browsers, you can right-click on a page and select Inspect Element to see the CSS selector details that you'll need to create your own scripts. \ud83d\udd35 Typing Text: self.type(selector, text) # updates the text from the specified element with the specified value. An exception is raised if the element is missing or if the text field is not editable. Example: self . type ( \"input#id_value\" , \"2012\" ) You can also use self.add_text() or the WebDriver .send_keys() command, but those won't clear the text box first if there's already text inside. If you want to type in special keys, that's easy too. Here's an example: from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys self . find_element ( \"textarea\" ) . send_keys ( Keys . SPACE + Keys . BACK_SPACE + ' \\n ' ) # The backspace should cancel out the space, leaving you with the newline \ud83d\udd35 Getting the text from an element on a page: text = self . get_text ( \"header h2\" ) \ud83d\udd35 Getting the attribute value from an element on a page: attribute = self . get_attribute ( \"#comic img\" , \"title\" ) \ud83d\udd35 Asserting existence of an element on a page within some number of seconds: self . wait_for_element_present ( \"div.my_class\" , timeout = 10 ) (NOTE: You can also use: self.assert_element_present(ELEMENT) ) \ud83d\udd35 Asserting visibility of an element on a page within some number of seconds: self . wait_for_element_visible ( \"a.my_class\" , timeout = 5 ) (NOTE: The short versions of this are self.find_element(ELEMENT) and self.assert_element(ELEMENT) . The find_element() version returns the element) Since the line above returns the element, you can combine that with .click() as shown below: self . find_element ( \"a.my_class\" , timeout = 5 ) . click () # But you're better off using the following statement, which does the same thing self . click ( \"a.my_class\" ) # DO IT THIS WAY! ProTip\u2122: You can use dots to signify class names (Ex: div.class_name ) as a simplified version of div[class=\"class_name\"] within a CSS selector. You can also use *= to search for any partial value in a CSS selector as shown below: self . click ( 'a[name*=\"partial_name\"]' ) \ud83d\udd35 Asserting visibility of text inside an element on a page within some number of seconds: self . assert_text ( \"Make it so!\" , \"div#trek div.picard div.quotes\" ) self . assert_text ( \"Tea.

For backwards compatibility, older method names were kept, but the default timeout may be different.) \ud83d\udd35 Asserting Anything: self . assert_true ( myvar1 == something ) self . assert_equal ( var1 , var2 ) \ud83d\udd35 Useful Conditional Statements: (with creative examples in action) is_element_visible(selector) # is an element visible on a page if self . is_element_visible ( 'div#warning' ): print ( \"Red Alert: Something bad might be happening!\" ) is_element_present(selector) # is an element present on a page if self . is_element_present ( 'div#top_secret img.tracking_cookie' ): self . contact_cookie_monster () # Not a real SeleniumBase method else : current_url = self . get_current_url () self . contact_the_nsa ( url = current_url , message = \"Dark Zone Found\" ) # Not a real SeleniumBase method Another example: def is_there_a_cloaked_klingon_ship_on_this_page (): if self . is_element_present ( \"div.ships div.klingon\" ): return not self . is_element_visible ( \"div.ships div.klingon\" ) return False is_text_visible(text, selector) # is text visible on a page def get_mirror_universe_captain_picard_superbowl_ad ( superbowl_year ): selector = \"div.superbowl_ %s div.commercials div.transcript div.picard\" % superbowl_year if self . is_text_visible ( \"For the Love of Marketing and Earl Grey Tea!\" , selector ): return \"Picard HubSpot Superbowl Ad 2015\" elif self . is_text_visible ( \"Delivery Drones...

Facebook\" , selector ): return \"Picard Facebook Superbowl Ad 2015\" else : raise Exception ( \"Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated.\" ) \ud83d\udd35 Switching Tabs: What if your test opens up a new tab/window and now you have more than one page? No problem. You need to specify which one you currently want Selenium to use. Switching between tabs/windows is easy: self . switch_to_window ( 1 ) # This switches to the new tab (0 is the first one) \ud83d\udd35 ProTip\u2122: iFrames follow the same principle as new windows - you need to specify the iFrame if you want to take action on something in there self . switch_to_frame ( 'ContentManagerTextBody_ifr' ) # Now you can act inside the iFrame # .... Do something cool (here) self . switch_to_default_content () # Exit the iFrame when you're done \ud83d\udd35 Handling Pop-Up Alerts: What if your test makes an alert pop up in your browser? No problem. You need to switch to it and either accept it or dismiss it: self . wait_for_and_accept_alert () self . wait_for_and_dismiss_alert () If you're not sure whether there's an alert before trying to accept or dismiss it, one way to handle that is to wrap your alert-handling code in a try/except block. Other methods such as .text and .send_keys() will also work with alerts. \ud83d\udd35 Executing Custom jQuery Scripts: jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to perform advanced actions in a web browser. If the web page you're on already has jQuery loaded, you can start executing jQuery scripts immediately. You'd know this because the web page would contain something like the following in the HTML: < script src = \"https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.4.1/jquery.min.js\" ></ script > \ud83d\udd35 It's OK if you want to use jQuery on a page that doesn't have it loaded yet. To do so, run the following command first: self . activate_jquery () \ud83d\udd35 Some websites have a restrictive Content Security Policy to prevent users from loading jQuery and other external libraries onto their websites. If you need to use jQuery or another JS library on such a website, add --disable-csp on the command-line. \ud83d\udd35 Here are some examples of using jQuery in your scripts: self . execute_script ( 'jQuery, window.scrollTo(0, 600)' ) # Scrolling the page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('#annoying-widget').hide()\" ) # Hiding elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('#hidden-widget').show(0)\" ) # Showing hidden elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('#annoying-button a').remove()\" ) # Removing elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery(' %s ').mouseover()\" % ( mouse_over_item )) # Mouse-over elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('input#the_id').val('my_text')\" ) # Fast text input on a page self . execute_script ( \"jQuery('div#dropdown a.link').click()\" ) # Click elements on a page self . execute_script ( \"return jQuery('div#amazing')[0].text\" ) # Returns the css \"text\" of the element given self . execute_script ( \"return jQuery('textarea')[2].value\" ) # Returns the css \"value\" of the 3rd textarea element on the page \ud83d\udd35 In the next example, JavaScript creates a referral button on a page, which is then clicked: start_page = \"https://xkcd.com/465/\" destination_page = \"https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase\" self . open ( start_page ) referral_link = '''<a class='analytics test' href=' %s '>Free-Referral Button!</a>''' % destination_page self . execute_script ( '''document.body.innerHTML = \\\" %s \\\" ''' % referral_link ) self . click ( \"a.analytics\" ) # Clicks the generated button (Due to popular demand, this traffic generation example has been baked into SeleniumBase with the self.generate_referral(start_page, end_page) and the self.generate_traffic(start_page, end_page, loops) methods.) \ud83d\udd35 Using deferred asserts: Let's say you want to verify multiple different elements on a web page in a single test, but you don't want the test to fail until you verified several elements at once so that you don't have to rerun the test to find more missing elements on the same page. That's where deferred asserts come in. Here's the example: from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_deferred_asserts ( self ): self . open ( 'https://xkcd.com/993/' ) self . wait_for_element ( '#comic' ) self . deferred_assert_element ( 'img[alt=\"Brand Identity\"]' ) self . deferred_assert_element ( 'img[alt=\"Rocket Ship\"]' ) # Will Fail self . deferred_assert_element ( '#comicmap' ) self . deferred_assert_text ( 'Fake Item' , '#middleContainer' ) # Will Fail self . deferred_assert_text ( 'Random' , '#middleContainer' ) self . deferred_assert_element ( 'a[name=\"Super Fake !!!\"]' ) # Will Fail self . process_deferred_asserts () deferred_assert_element() and deferred_assert_text() will save any exceptions that would be raised. To flush out all the failed deferred asserts into a single exception, make sure to call self.process_deferred_asserts() at the end of your test method. If your test hits multiple pages, you can call self.process_deferred_asserts() before navigating to a new page so that the screenshot from your log files matches the URL where the deferred asserts were made. \ud83d\udd35 Accessing Raw WebDriver If you need access to any commands that come with standard WebDriver, you can call them directly like this: self . driver . delete_all_cookies () capabilities = self . driver . capabilities self . driver . find_elements_by_partial_link_text ( \"GitHub\" ) (In general, you'll want to use the SeleniumBase versions of methods when available.) \ud83d\udd35 Retrying failing tests automatically: You can use --reruns=NUM to retry failing tests that many times. Use --reruns-delay=SECONDS to wait that many seconds between retries. Example: pytest --reruns = 1 --reruns-delay = 1 Additionally, you can use the @retry_on_exception() decorator to specifically retry failing methods.

Examples of expected log files generated during failures: basic_test_info.txt page_source.html screenshot.png In addition to log files, you can also generate dashboards and test reports. The SeleniumBase Dashboard: \ud83d\udd35 The --dashboard option for pytest generates a SeleniumBase Dashboard located at dashboard.html , which updates automatically as tests run and produce results. Example: pytest --dashboard --rs --headless \ud83d\udd35 Additionally, you can host your own SeleniumBase Dashboard Server on a port of your choice. Here's an example of that using Python 3's http.server : python -m http.server 1948 \ud83d\udd35 Now you can navigate to http://localhost:1948/dashboard.html in order to view the dashboard as a web app. This requires two different terminal windows: one for running the server, and another for running the tests, which should be run from the same directory.

Instead of comparing pixels from screenshots, layout differences can be detected by comparing HTML tags and attributes with a baseline. If a change is detected, it could mean that something broke, the web page was redesigned, or dynamic content changed. ( Watch the tutorial on YouTube \u2198\ufe0f ) To handle automated visual testing, SeleniumBase uses the self.check_window() method, which can set visual baselines for comparison and then compare the latest versions of web pages to the existing baseline. The first time a test calls self.check_window() with a unique name parameter, the visual baseline is set, which means a folder is created with the following files: page_url.txt -> The URL of the current window screenshot.png -> A screenshot of the current window tags_level1.txt -> HTML tags from the window tags_level2.txt -> HTML tags + attribute names tags_level3.txt -> HTML tags + attribute names+values After the first time self.check_window() is called, later calls will compare the HTML tags and attributes of the latest window to the ones from the first call ( or to the ones from the call when the baseline was last reset ). Here's an example call: self . check_window ( name = \"first_test)\" , level = 3 ) On the first run ( or if the baseline is being set/reset ) the \"level\" doesn't matter because that's only used for comparing the current layout to the existing baseline. Here's how the level system works: level=0 -> DRY RUN ONLY - Will perform a comparison to the baseline, and print out any differences that are found, but won't fail the test even if differences exist. level=1 -> HTML tags are compared to tags_level1.txt level=2 -> HTML tags and attribute names are compared to tags_level2.txt level=3 -> HTML tags and attribute names+values are compared to tags_level3.txt As shown, Level-3 is the most strict, Level-1 is the least strict. If the comparisons from the latest window to the existing baseline don't match, the current test will fail, except for Level-0 checks, which print Level-3 results without failing the test. You can reset the visual baseline on the command line by adding the following parameter at runtime: --visual_baseline As long as --visual_baseline is used on the command line while running tests, the self.check_window() method cannot fail because it will rebuild the visual baseline rather than comparing the html tags of the latest run to the existing baseline. If there are any expected layout changes to a website that you're testing, you'll need to reset the baseline to prevent unnecessary failures. self.check_window() will fail with \"Page Domain Mismatch Failure\" if the domain of the current URL doesn't match the domain of the baseline URL. If you want to use self.check_window() to compare a web page to a later version of itself in the same test, add the baseline=True parameter to your first self.check_window() call to use that as the baseline. ( This only makes sense if you're calling self.check_window() more than once with the same \"name\" parameter in the same test. ) Automated Visual Testing with self.check_window() is not very effective for websites that have dynamic content because that changes the layout and structure of web pages. For those pages, you're much better off using regular SeleniumBase functional testing, unless you can remove the dynamic content before performing the comparison, (such as by using self.ad_block() to remove dynamic ad content on a web page). Example usage of self.check_window() with different levels: self . check_window ( name = \"testing\" , level = 0 ) self . check_window ( name = \"xkcd_home\" , level = 1 ) self . check_window ( name = \"github_page\" , level = 2 ) self . check_window ( name = \"wikipedia_page\" , level = 3 ) self . check_window ( name = \"helloworld\" , baseline = True ) ### Do something that may change the web page self . check_window ( name = \"helloworld\" , level = 3 ) Here's an example where clicking a button makes a hidden element visible: from seleniumbase import BaseCase class VisualLayoutTest ( BaseCase ): def test_applitools_layout_change_failure ( self ): self . open ( 'https://applitools.com/helloworld?diff1' ) print ( ' \\n Creating baseline in \"visual_baseline\" folder.' ) self . check_window ( name = \"helloworld\" , baseline = True ) # Click a button that changes the text of an element self . click ( 'a[href=\"?diff1\"]' ) # Click a button that makes a hidden element visible self . click ( \"button\" ) self . check_window ( name = \"helloworld\" , level = 3 ) Here's the output of that: ( Text changes do not impact visual comparisons ) AssertionError: First differing element 39: ['div', [['class', ['section', 'hidden-section', 'image-section']]]] ['div', [['class', ['section', 'image-section']]]] - ['div', [['class', ['section', 'hidden-section', 'image-section']]]], ? ------------------ + ['div', [['class', ['section', 'image-section']]]], * *** Exception: <Level 3> Visual Diff Failure: * HTML tag attribute values don't match the baseline!

Here are some examples of configuring tests, which can be run from the examples/ folder: # Run a test in Chrome (default browser) pytest my_first_test.py # Run a test in Firefox pytest test_swag_labs.py --browser = firefox # Run a test in Demo Mode (highlight assertions) pytest test_demo_site.py --demo # Run a test in Headless Mode (invisible browser) pytest test_demo_site.py --headless # Run tests multi-threaded using [n] threads pytest test_suite.py -n = 4 # Create a pytest html report after tests are done pytest test_suite.py --html = report.html # Enter Debug Mode on failures pytest test_fail.py --pdb # Rerun failing tests more times pytest test_suite.py --reruns = 1 # Pass extra data into tests (retrieve by calling self.data) pytest my_first_test.py --data = \"ABC,DEF\" # Run tests on a local Selenium Grid pytest test_suite.py --server = \"127.0.0.1\" # Run tests on a remote Selenium Grid pytest test_suite.py --server = IP_ADDRESS --port = 4444 # Run tests on a remote Selenium Grid with authentication pytest test_suite.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@IP_ADDRESS --port = 80 # Reuse the same browser session for all tests being run pytest test_suite.py --reuse-session # Reuse the same browser session, but empty cookies between tests pytest test_suite.py --reuse-session --crumbs # Run tests through a proxy server pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = IP_ADDRESS:PORT # Run tests through a proxy server with authentication pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_ADDRESS:PORT # Run tests while setting the web browser's User Agent pytest user_agent_test.py --agent = \"USER-AGENT-STRING\" # Run tests using Chrome's mobile device emulator (default settings) pytest test_swag_labs.py --mobile # Run mobile tests specifying CSS Width, CSS Height, and Pixel-Ratio pytest test_swag_labs.py --mobile --metrics = \"411,731,3\" # Run tests while changing SeleniumBase default settings pytest my_first_test.py --settings-file = custom_settings.py You can interchange pytest with nosetests for most tests, but using pytest is recommended. ( chrome is the default browser if not specified.) If you're using pytest for running tests outside of the SeleniumBase repo, you'll want a copy of pytest.ini at the base of the new folder structure. If using nosetests , the same applies for setup.cfg . Here are some useful command-line options that come with pytest : -v # Verbose mode. Prints the full name of each test run. -q # Quiet mode. Print fewer details in the console output when running tests. -x # Stop running the tests after the first failure is reached. --html = report.html # Creates a detailed pytest-html report after tests finish. --collect-only | --co # Show what tests would get run.

(For more details, see the full list of command-line options here .) You can also view a list of popular pytest options for SeleniumBase by typing: seleniumbase options Or the short form: sbase options Customizing default settings: An easy way to override seleniumbase/config/settings.py is by using a custom settings file. Here's the command-line option to add to tests: (See examples/custom_settings.py ) --settings-file=custom_settings.py (Settings include default timeout values, a two-factor auth key, DB credentials, S3 credentials, and other important settings used by tests.) Running tests on a remote Selenium Grid: SeleniumBase lets you run tests on remote Selenium Grids such as BrowserStack 's Selenium Grid, Sauce Labs 's Selenium Grid, TestingBot 's Selenium Grid, other Grids, and even your own Grid: (For setting browser desired capabilities while running Selenium remotely, see the ReadMe located here: https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/tree/master/examples/capabilities) Here's how to connect to a BrowserStack Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.browserstack.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a Sauce Labs Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a TestingBot Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.testingbot.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a CrossBrowserTesting Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.crossbrowsertesting.com --port = 80 Here's how to connect to a LambdaTest Selenium Grid server for running tests: pytest my_first_test.py --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.lambdatest.com --port = 80 Or you can create your own Selenium Grid for test distribution. ( See this ReadMe for details ) Example tests using Logging: pytest test_suite.py --browser = chrome \ud83d\udd35 During test failures, logs and screenshots from the most recent test run will get saved to the latest_logs/ folder. If --archive-logs is specified (or if ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS is set to True in settings.py ), test logs will also get archived to the archived_logs/ folder. Otherwise, the log files will be cleaned out when the next test run begins (by default). Demo Mode: If any test is moving too fast for your eyes to see what's going on, you can run it in Demo Mode by adding --demo on the command line, which pauses the browser briefly between actions, highlights page elements being acted on, and lets you know what test assertions are happening in real time: pytest my_first_test.py --demo You can override the default wait time by either updating settings.py or by using --demo-sleep={NUM} when using Demo Mode. (NOTE: If you use --demo-sleep={NUM} without using --demo , nothing will happen.) pytest my_first_test.py --demo --demo-sleep = 1 .2 Passing additional data to tests: If you want to pass additional data from the command line to your tests, you can use --data=STRING . Now inside your tests, you can use self.data to access that. Running tests multithreaded: To run Pytest multithreaded on multiple CPUs at the same time, add -n=NUM or -n NUM on the command line, where NUM is the number of CPUs you want to use. Retrying failing tests automatically: You can use --reruns=NUM to retry failing tests that many times. Use --reruns-delay=SECONDS to wait that many seconds between retries. Example: pytest --reruns = 1 --reruns-delay = 1 Debugging tests: You can use the following calls in your scripts to help you debug issues: import time ; time . sleep ( 5 ) # Makes the test wait and do nothing for 5 seconds. import ipdb ; ipdb . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. import pytest ; pytest . set_trace () # Enter debugging mode. n = next, c = continue, s = step. To pause an active test that throws an exception or error, add --pdb -s : pytest my_first_test.py --pdb -s The code above will leave your browser window open in case there's a failure. (ipdb commands: 'c', 's', 'n' => continue, step, next). The SeleniumBase Dashboard: \ud83d\udd35 The --dashboard option for pytest generates a SeleniumBase Dashboard located at dashboard.html , which updates automatically as tests run and produce results. Example: pytest --dashboard --rs --headless \ud83d\udd35 Additionally, you can host your own SeleniumBase Dashboard Server on a port of your choice. Here's an example of that using Python 3's http.server : python -m http.server 1948 \ud83d\udd35 Now you can navigate to http://localhost:1948/dashboard.html in order to view the dashboard as a web app. This requires two different terminal windows: one for running the server, and another for running the tests, which should be run from the same directory. (Use CTRL+C to stop the http server.) \ud83d\udd35 Here's a full example of what the SeleniumBase Dashboard may look like: pytest test_suite.py --dashboard --rs --headless Pytest Reports: \ud83d\udd35 Using --html=report.html gives you a fancy report of the name specified after your test suite completes. pytest test_suite.py --html = report.html \ud83d\udd35 When combining pytest html reports with SeleniumBase Dashboard usage, the pie chart from the Dashboard will get added to the html report. Additionally, if you set the html report URL to be the same as the Dashboard URL when also using the dashboard, (example: --dashboard --html=dashboard.html ), then the Dashboard will become an advanced html report when all the tests complete. \ud83d\udd35 Here's an example of an upgraded html report: pytest test_suite.py --dashboard --html = report.html If viewing pytest html reports in Jenkins , you may need to configure Jenkins settings for the html to render correctly. This is due to Jenkins CSP changes . You can also use --junit-xml=report.xml to get an xml report instead. Jenkins can use this file to display better reporting for your tests. pytest test_suite.py --junit-xml = report.xml Nosetest Reports: The --report option gives you a fancy report after your test suite completes. nosetests test_suite.py --report (NOTE: You can add --show_report to immediately display Nosetest reports after the test suite completes. Only use --show_report when running tests locally because it pauses the test run.) Using a Proxy Server: If you wish to use a proxy server for your browser tests (Chromium or Firefox), you can add --proxy=IP_ADDRESS:PORT as an argument on the command line. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = IP_ADDRESS:PORT If the proxy server that you wish to use requires authentication, you can do the following (Chromium only): pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = USERNAME:PASSWORD@IP_ADDRESS:PORT SeleniumBase also supports SOCKS4 and SOCKS5 proxies: pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = \"socks4://IP_ADDRESS:PORT\" pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = \"socks5://IP_ADDRESS:PORT\" To make things easier, you can add your frequently-used proxies to PROXY_LIST in proxy_list.py , and then use --proxy=KEY_FROM_PROXY_LIST to use the IP_ADDRESS:PORT of that key. pytest proxy_test.py --proxy = proxy1 Changing the User-Agent: If you wish to change the User-Agent for your browser tests (Chrome and Firefox only), you can add --agent=\"USER-AGENT-STRING\" as an argument on the command line. pytest user_agent_test.py --agent = \"Mozilla/5.0 (Nintendo 3DS; U; ; en) Version/1.7412.EU\" Mobile Device Testing: Use --mobile to quickly run your tests using Chrome's mobile device emulator with default values for device metrics (CSS Width, CSS Height, Pixel-Ratio) and a default value set for the user agent. To configure the mobile device metrics, use --metrics=\"CSS_Width,CSS_Height,Pixel_Ratio\" to set those values.

Sample run commands may look like this when run from the SeleniumBase/examples/ folder: (The browser is now specified in the capabilities file.) pytest my_first_test.py --browser = remote --server = USERNAME:KEY@hub.browserstack.com --port = 80 --cap_file = capabilities/sample_cap_file_BS.py pytest my_first_test.py --browser = remote --server = USERNAME:KEY@ondemand.saucelabs.com --port = 80 --cap_file = capabilities/sample_cap_file_SL.py (Parameters: --browser=remote , --server=SERVER , --port=PORT , and --cap_file=CAP_FILE.py ) Here's an example desired capabilities file for BrowserStack: desired_cap = { 'os' : 'OS X' , 'os_version' : 'High Sierra' , 'browser' : 'Chrome' , 'browser_version' : '77.0' , 'browserstack.local' : 'false' , 'browserstack.selenium_version' : '3.141.59' } Here's an example desired capabilities file for Sauce Labs: capabilities = { 'browserName' : 'firefox' , 'browserVersion' : '70.0' , 'platformName' : 'macOS 10.13' , 'sauce:options' : { } } (You'll notice that the browser is now being specified in the capabilities file, rather than with --browser=BROWSER ) You can generate specific desired capabilities using: BrowserStack desired capabilities Sauce Labs desired capabilities TestingBot desired capabilities Parsing desired capabilities: SeleniumBase has a desired capabilities parser that can capture all lines from the specified file in the following formats: 'KEY': 'VALUE' 'KEY': True 'KEY': False caps['KEY'] = \"VALUE\" caps['KEY'] = True caps['KEY'] = False (Each pair must be on a separate line. You can interchange single and double quotes.) You can also swap --browser=remote with an actual browser, eg --browser=chrome , which will combine the default SeleniumBase desired capabilities with those that were specified in the capabilities file when using --cap_file=FILE.py . Capabilities will override other parameters, so if you set the browser to one thing and the capabilities browser to another, SeleniumBase will use the capabilities browser as the browser. You'll need default SeleniumBase capabilities for: * Using a proxy server (not the same as a Selenium Grid server) * Downloading files to a desired folder * Disabling some warnings on Chrome * Overriding a website's Content Security Policy on Chrome * Other possible reasons You can also set browser desired capabilities from a command line string: Example: pytest test_swag_labs.py --cap-string = '{\"browserName\":\"chrome\",\"name\":\"test1\"}' --server = \"127.0.0.1\" --browser = remote (Enclose cap-string in single quotes. Enclose parameter keys in double quotes.) If you pass \"*\" into the \"name\" field of --cap-string , the name will become the test identifier. Example: pytest test_swag_labs.py --cap-string = '{\"browserName\":\"chrome\",\"name\":\"*\"}' --server = \"127.0.0.1\" --browser = chrome Example name: \"my_first_test.MyTestClass.test_basics\" Using a local Selenium Grid If using a local Selenium Grid with SeleniumBase, start up the Grid Hub and nodes first: seleniumbase grid-hub start seleniumbase grid-node start (The Selenium Server JAR file will be automatically downloaded for first-time Grid users.

Here's an example of loading a website-tour library into the browser while visiting Google: This example, ( google_tour.py from the SeleniumBase examples/tour_examples/ folder), can be run with pytest after you've cloned and installed SeleniumBase from GitHub : pytest google_tour.py Since a CDN is used for holding packages, you no longer need to use other package managers such as NPM, Bower, or Yarn. Here's the Python code for loading JS packages into the web browser with SeleniumBase: self . add_js_link ( js_link ) This example loads the IntroJS JavaScript library: self . add_js_link ( \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/intro.js/2.9.3/intro.min.js\" ) You can load any JS package this way as long as you know the URL. If you're wondering how SeleniumBase does this, here's the full Python code, which uses WebDriver's execute_script() method for making JS calls after escaping quotes: def add_js_link ( driver , js_link ): script_to_add_js = ( \"\"\"function injectJS(link) { var body = document.getElementsByTagName(\"body\")[0]; var script = document.createElement(\"script\"); script.src = link; script.defer; script.type=\"text/javascript\"; script.crossorigin = \"anonymous\"; script.onload = function() { null }; body.appendChild(script); } injectJS(\"%s\");\"\"\" ) js_link = escape_quotes_if_needed ( js_link ) driver . execute_script ( script_to_add_js % js_link ) Now that you've loaded JavaScript into the browser, you may also want to load some CSS to go along with it: self . add_css_link ( css_link ) Here's code that loads the IntroJS CSS: self . add_css_link ( \"https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/intro.js/2.9.3/introjs.css\" ) And here's the Python WebDriver code that makes this possible: def add_css_link ( driver , css_link ): script_to_add_css = ( \"\"\"function injectCSS(css) { var head = document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0]; var link = document.createElement(\"link\"); link.rel = \"stylesheet\"; link.type = \"text/css\"; link.href = css; link.crossorigin = \"anonymous\"; head.appendChild(link); } injectCSS(\"%s\");\"\"\" ) css_link = escape_quotes_if_needed ( css_link ) driver . execute_script ( script_to_add_css % css_link ) Website tours are just one of the many ways of using the SeleniumBase JS Package Manager. The following example shows the JqueryConfirm package loaded into a website for creating fancy dialog boxes: (Example from SeleniumBase's MasterQA ReadMe ) Since packages are loaded directly from a CDN, such as CloudFlare's cdnjs , there's no need to use NPM, Bower, Yarn, or other package managers to get the packages that you need into the websites that you want.

Example: pytest my_first_test.py --with-db_reporting", "title": "Allow tests to write to your MySQL database"}, {"location": "help_docs/syntax_formats/", "text": "The 15 syntax formats ( Watch this tutorial on YouTube ) SeleniumBase supports 15 different syntax formats for structuring tests. ( The first 4 are the most common. ) 1. BaseCase direct inheritance This format is used by most of the examples in the SeleniumBase examples folder . It's a great starting point for anyone learning SeleniumBase, and it follows good object-oriented programming principles. In this format, BaseCase is imported at the top of a Python file, followed by a Python class inheriting BaseCase . Then, any test method defined in that class automatically gains access to SeleniumBase methods, including the setUp() and tearDown() methods that are automatically called to spin up and spin down web browsers at the beginning and end of test methods. Here's an example of that: from seleniumbase import BaseCase class MyTestClass ( BaseCase ): def test_demo_site ( self ): self . open ( \"https://seleniumbase.io/demo_page\" ) self . type ( \"#myTextInput\" , \"This is Automated\" ) self . click ( \"#myButton\" ) self . assert_element ( \"tbody#tbodyId\" ) self . assert_text ( \"Automation Practice\" , \"h3\" ) self . click_link ( \"SeleniumBase Demo Page\" ) self . assert_exact_text ( \"Demo Page\" , \"h1\" ) self . assert_no_js_errors () (See examples/test_demo_site.py for the full test.) 2. BaseCase subclass inheritance There are situations where you may want to customize the setUp and tearDown of your tests. Maybe you want to have all your tests login to a specific web site first, or maybe you want to have your tests report results through an API call depending on whether a test passed or failed. This can be done by creating a subclass of BaseCase and then carefully creating custom setUp() and tearDown() methods that don't overwrite the critical functionality of the default SeleniumBase setUp() and tearDown() methods. Afterwards, your test classes will inherit the subclass of BaseCase with the added functionality, rather than directly inheriting BaseCase itself. Here's an example of that: from seleniumbase import BaseCase class BaseTestCase ( BaseCase ): def setUp ( self ): super ( BaseTestCase , self ) . setUp () # <<< Run custom setUp() code for tests AFTER the super().setUp() >>> def tearDown ( self ): self . save_teardown_screenshot () if self . has_exception (): # <<< Run custom code if the test failed. >>> pass else : # <<< Run custom code if the test passed. >>> pass # (Wrap unreliable tearDown() code in a try/except block.) # <<< Run custom tearDown() code BEFORE the super().tearDown() >>> super ( BaseTestCase , self ) . tearDown () def login ( self ): # <<< Placeholder. Add your code here. >>> # Reduce duplicate code in tests by having reusable methods like this. # If the UI changes, the fix can be applied in one place. pass def example_method ( self ): # <<< Placeholder. Add your code here. >>> pass class MyTests ( BaseTestCase ): def test_example ( self ): self . login () self . example_method () self . type ( \"input\" , \"Name\" ) self . click ( \"form button\" ) ... (See examples/boilerplates/base_test_case.py for more info.) 3. The sb pytest fixture (no class) The pytest framework comes with a unique system called fixtures, which replaces import statements at the top of Python files by importing libraries directly into test definitions. More than just being an import, a pytest fixture can also automatically call predefined setUp() and tearDown() methods at the beginning and end of test methods. To work, sb is added as an argument to each test method definition that needs SeleniumBase functionality. This means you no longer need import statements in your Python files to use SeleniumBase. If using other pytest fixtures in your tests, you may need to use the SeleniumBase fixture (instead of BaseCase class inheritance) for compatibility reasons. Here's an example of the sb fixture in a test that does not use Python classes: def test_sb_fixture_with_no_class ( sb ): sb . open ( \"https://google.com/ncr\" ) sb . type ( 'input[title=\"Search\"]' , 'SeleniumBase \\n ' ) sb . click ( 'a[href*=\"github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase\"]' ) sb . click ( 'a[title=\"seleniumbase\"]' ) (See the top of examples/test_sb_fixture.py for the test.) 4. The sb pytest fixture (in class) The sb pytest fixture can also be used inside of a class. There is a slight change to the syntax because that means test methods must also include self in their argument definitions when test methods are defined. (The self argument represents the class object, and is used in every test method that lives inside of a class.) Once again, no import statements are needed in your Python files for this to work. Here's an example of using the sb fixture in a test method that lives inside of a Python class: class Test_SB_Fixture (): def test_sb_fixture_inside_class ( self , sb ): sb . open ( \"https://google.com/ncr\" ) sb . type ( 'input[title=\"Search\"]' , 'SeleniumBase \\n ' ) sb . click ( 'a[href*=\"github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase\"]' ) sb . click ( 'a[title=\"examples\"]' ) (See the bottom of examples/test_sb_fixture.py for the test.) 5. Using the request fixture to get the sb fixture (no class) The pytest request fixture can be used to retrieve other pytest fixtures from within tests, such as the sb fixture. This allows you to have more control over when fixtures get initialized because the fixture no longer needs to be loaded at the very beginning of test methods. This is done by calling request.getfixturevalue('sb') from the test. Here's an example of using the pytest request fixture to load the sb fixture in a test method that does not use Python classes: def test_request_sb_fixture ( request ): sb = request . getfixturevalue ( 'sb' ) sb . open ( \"https://seleniumbase.io/demo_page\" ) sb . assert_text ( \"SeleniumBase\" , \"#myForm h2\" ) sb . assert_element ( \"input#myTextInput\" ) sb . type ( \"#myTextarea\" , \"This is me\" ) sb . click ( \"#myButton\" ) sb . tearDown () (See the top of examples/test_request_sb_fixture.py for the test.) 6. Using the request fixture to get the sb fixture (in class) The pytest request fixture can also be used to get the sb fixture from inside a Python class. Here's an example of that: class Test_Request_Fixture (): def test_request_sb_fixture_in_class ( self , request ): sb = request . getfixturevalue ( 'sb' ) sb . open ( \"https://seleniumbase.io/demo_page\" ) sb . assert_element ( \"input#myTextInput\" ) sb . type ( \"#myTextarea\" , \"Automated\" ) sb . assert_text ( \"This Text is Green\" , \"#pText\" ) sb . click ( \"#myButton\" ) sb . assert_text ( \"This Text is Purple\" , \"#pText\" ) sb . tearDown () (See the bottom of examples/test_request_sb_fixture.py for the test.) 7.

Examples can be found in [ SeleniumBase/examples/translations ]. Multi-language tests are run with pytest like any other test. Every test method has a one-to-one mapping to every other supported language. Example: self.open(URL) <=> self.\u5f00\u542f\u7f51\u5740(URL) Translation API You can use SeleniumBase to selectively translate the method names of any test from one language to another via the console scripts interface. Additionally, the import line at the top of the Python file will change to import the new BaseCase . Example: BaseCase becomes CasoDeTeste when a test is translated into Portuguese. seleniumbase translate * Usage: seleniumbase translate [ SB_FILE.py ] [ LANGUAGE ] [ ACTION ] * Languages: `` --en `` / `` --English `` | `` --zh `` / `` --Chinese `` `` --nl `` / `` --Dutch `` | `` --fr `` / `` --French `` `` --it `` / `` --Italian `` | `` --ja `` / `` --Japanese `` `` --ko `` / `` --Korean `` | `` --pt `` / `` --Portuguese `` `` --ru `` / `` --Russian `` | `` --es `` / `` --Spanish `` * Actions: `` -p `` / `` --print `` ( Print translation output to the screen ) `` -o `` / `` --overwrite `` ( Overwrite the file being translated ) `` -c `` / `` --copy `` ( Copy the translation to a new `` .py `` file ) * Options: `` -n `` ( include line Numbers when using the Print action ) * Examples: Translate test_1.py into Chinese and only print the output: >>> seleniumbase translate test_1.py --zh -p Translate test_2.py into Portuguese and overwrite the file: >>> seleniumbase translate test_2.py --pt -o Translate test_3.py into Dutch and make a copy of the file: >>> seleniumbase translate test_3.py --nl -c * Output: Translates a SeleniumBase Python file into the language specified. Method calls and `` import `` lines get swapped. Both a language and an action must be specified. The `` -p `` action can be paired with one other action. When running with `` -c `` ( or `` --copy `` ) the new file name will be the original name appended with an underscore plus the 2 -letter language code of the new language. ( Example: Translating `` test_1.py `` into Japanese with `` -c `` will create a new file called `` test_1_ja.py `` . )", "title": "Translations"}, {"location": "help_docs/using_safari_driver/", "text": "Using Safari's WebDriver for running browser tests on macOS \u00b6 (NOTE: Safari's WebDriver requires macOS 10.13 \"High Sierra\" or later.)

This tutorial covers two of those: The venv command ( included with Python 3+ ). The virtualenvwrapper mkvirtualenv command. venv creates virtual environments in the location where run ( generally with Python projects ). mkvirtualenv creates virtual environments in one place ( generally in your home directory ). (The Python Software Foundation recommends venv for creating virtual environments.) Part 1: Using \"venv\" macOS/Linux terminal ( python3 -m venv ENV ) python3 -m venv sbase_env source sbase_env/bin/activate Windows CMD prompt ( py -m venv ENV ): py -m venv sbase_env call sbase_env \\\\ Scripts \\\\ activate To exit a virtual env, type deactivate . Part 2: Using virtualenvwrapper macOS/Linux terminal: python3 -m pip install virtualenvwrapper --force-reinstall export WORKON_HOME = $HOME /.virtualenvs source ` which virtualenvwrapper.sh ` ( Shortcut : Run source virtualenv_install.sh from the top-level SeleniumBase folder to perform the above steps.) (If you add source `which virtualenvwrapper.sh` to your local bash file ( ~/.bash_profile on macOS, or ~/.bashrc on Linux), virtualenvwrapper commands such as mkvirtualenv will be available whenever you open a new command prompt.) Windows CMD prompt: py -m pip install virtualenvwrapper-win --force-reinstall --user ( Shortcut : Run win_virtualenv.bat from the top-level SeleniumBase folder to perform the above step.) Create a virtual environment: mkvirtualenv ENV : mkvirtualenv sbase_env (If you have multiple versions of Python installed on your machine, and you want your virtual environment to use a specific Python version, add --python=PATH_TO_PYTHON_EXE to your mkvirtualenv command with the Python executable to use.) virtualenvwrapper commands: Creating a virtual environment: mkvirtualenv sbase_env Leaving your virtual environment: deactivate Returning to a virtual environment: workon sbase_env Listing all virtual environments: workon Deleting a virtual environment: rmvirtualenv sbase_env python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs has more information about Python virtual environments.

On macOS and Linux, /usr/local/bin is a good PATH spot. On Windows, you may need to set the System PATH under Environment Variables to include the location where you placed the driver files. As a shortcut, you could place the driver files into your Python Scripts/ folder in the location where you have Python installed, which should already be on your System PATH. Here's where you can go to manually install web drivers from the source: For Chrome, get Chromedriver on your System PATH. For Firefox, get Geckodriver on your System PATH. For Microsoft Edge, get Edge Driver (Microsoft WebDriver) on your System PATH. For Safari, get Safari Driver on your System PATH. For Opera, get Opera Chromium Driver on your System PATH..

Launch a Jenkins instance \u00b6 Click \"Create\" and follow the steps... \u00b6 Continue to \"Additional Settings\" when you're done with \"Basics\". \u00b6 On the \"Additional Settings\" section, set the Size to \"B2s\": \u00b6 Once you've reached Step 5, click \"Create\" to complete the setup. \u00b6 Step 3. Inspect your new Jenkins instance to SSH into the new machine \u00b6 Once your new Jenkins instance has finished launching, you should be able to see the main page \u00b6 On the main page, you should be able to find the Public IP Address. \u00b6 Use that IP Address to SSH into the machine: ssh USERNAME@IP_ADDRESS Step 4. Clone the SeleniumBase repository from the root (\"/\") directory. \u00b6 cd / sudo git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git Step 5. Enter the \"linux\" folder \u00b6 cd SeleniumBase/integrations/linux/ Step 6. Give the \"jenkins\" user sudo access (See jenkins_permissions.sh for details) \u00b6 ./jenkins_permissions.sh Step 7. Become the \"jenkins\" user and enter a \"bash\" shell \u00b6 sudo su jenkins bash Step 8. Install dependencies (See Linuxfile.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Linuxfile.sh Step 9. Start up the headless browser display mechanism: Xvfb (See Xvfb_launcher.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Xvfb_launcher.sh Step 10. Go to the SeleniumBase directory \u00b6 cd /SeleniumBase Step 11. Install the requirements for SeleniumBase \u00b6 sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade Step 12.

Secure your Jenkins machine \u00b6 Navigate to http://JENKINS_IP_ADDRESS/jenkins-on-azure/ \u00b6 (Depending on your version of Jenkins, you may see the following screen, or nothing at all.) Initially, Jenkins uses only http , which makes it less secure. \u00b6 You'll need to set up SSH Port Forwarding in order to secure it. \u00b6 To do this, copy/paste the string and run it in a NEW command prompt on your local machine (NOT from an SSH terminal session), swapping out the username and DNS name with the ones you set up when creating the Jenkins instance in Azure. ssh -L 127.0.0.1:8080:localhost:8080 USERNAME@DNS_NAME Step 16. Login to Jenkins \u00b6 If you've correctly set up SSH Port Forwarding, the url will be http://127.0.0.1:8080/ \u00b6 You'll need to get the password from the SSH terminal on the Linux machine to log in \u00b6 sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword Step 17. Customize Jenkins \u00b6 Step 18. Create an Admin user \u00b6 Once Jenkins has finished loading, the top left of the page should look like this \u00b6 Step 19. Create a new Jenkins job \u00b6 Click on \"New Item\" Give your new Jenkins job a name (ex: \"Test1\") Select \"Freestyle project\" Click \"OK\" Step 20. Setup your new Jenkins job \u00b6 Under \"Source Code Management\", select \"Git\". For the \"Repository URL\", put: https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git .

Run your new Jenkins job \u00b6 Click on \"Build Now\" (If everything was done correctly, you'll see a blue dot appear after a few seconds, indicating that the test job passed.) Step 22. See the top Jenkins page for an overview of all jobs \u00b6 Step 23. Future Work \u00b6 If you have a web application that you want to test, you'll be able to create SeleniumBase tests and add them to Jenkins as you saw here. You may want to create a Deploy job, which downloads the latest version of your repository, and then kicks off all tests to run after that. You could then tell that Deploy job to auto-run whenever a change is pushed to your repository by using: \"Poll SCM\".

The cost of running this server is about $13.61/month on Google Cloud (enough to handle 5 parallel tests ). This is less expensive than using other platforms such as BrowserStack or Sauce Labs .) ( Here's a quick video recap on YouTube: ) Step 1. Open the Google Cloud Platform Cloud Launcher \u00b6 Navigate to https://console.cloud.google.com/launcher (If you already have an active Google Cloud project, the Google Cloud Launcher will probably default to using that. If you don't, sign up for the free trial of Google Cloud Platform here to get started.) Step 2. Launch a Jenkins instance \u00b6 Under \"Cloud Launcher\", Click on \"Jenkins Certified by Bitnami\" Click on \"Launch on Compute Engine\" Give the instance a name Give the instance a zone Click \"Create\" Step 3. Connect with your new Jenkins instance \u00b6 SSH into your new instance by selecting: \"SSH\" => \"Open in browser window\" from the instance page. Step 4. Clone the SeleniumBase repository from the root (\"/\") directory. \u00b6 cd / sudo git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git Step 5. Enter the \"linux\" folder \u00b6 cd SeleniumBase/integrations/linux/ Step 6. Give Jenkins (aka \"tomcat\" user) sudo access (See tomcat_permissions.sh for details) \u00b6 ./tomcat_permissions.sh Step 7. Become \"tomcat\" (the Jenkins user) and enter a \"bash\" shell \u00b6 sudo su tomcat bash Step 8. Install dependencies (See Linuxfile.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Linuxfile.sh Step 9. Start up the headless browser display mechanism: Xvfb (See Xvfb_launcher.sh for details) \u00b6 ./Xvfb_launcher.sh Step 10. Go to the SeleniumBase directory \u00b6 cd /SeleniumBase Step 11. Install the requirements for SeleniumBase \u00b6 sudo pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade Step 12. Install SeleniumBase \u00b6 sudo python setup.py develop Step 13. Run an example test on Chrome to verify installation (May take up to 10 seconds) \u00b6 pytest examples/my_first_test.py --headless Step 14. If you prefer using nosetests, that works too \u00b6 nosetests examples/my_first_test.py --headless Step 15. You can also verify that the example test runs on Firefox \u00b6 nosetests examples/my_first_test.py --headless --browser = firefox Step 16. Login to Jenkins \u00b6 (The url, as well as username and password, should be accessible from your Google Cloud Platform VM instance page.) Step 17. Create a new Jenkins job \u00b6 Click on \"New Item\" Give your new Jenkins job a name (ex: \"My_First_Test\") Select \"Freestyle project\" Click \"OK\" Step 18. Setup your new Jenkins job \u00b6 Under \"Source Code Management\", select \"Git\". For the \"Repository URL\", put: https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git . (You'll eventually be using your own clone of the repository here.) Under \"Build\", click the \"Add build step\" dropdown and then select \"Execute shell\".

Future Work \u00b6 If you have a web application that you want to test, you'll be able to create SeleniumBase tests and add them to Jenkins as you saw here. You may want to create a Deploy job, which downloads the latest version of your repository, and then kicks off all tests to run after that. You could then tell that Deploy job to auto-run whenever a change is pushed to your repository by using: \"Poll SCM\". All your tests would then be able to run by using: \"Build after other projects are built\". You can also use MySQL to save test results in the DB so that you can query the data at any time. Congratulations! You're now well on your way to becoming a build & release / automation engineer! \u00b6 MySQL DB setup instructions \u00b6 Step 21. Return to the Google Cloud Launcher and launch a MySQL Instance \u00b6 Under \"Featured Solutions\", Click on \"MySQL\" Click on \"Launch on Compute Engine\" Give the instance a name Give the instance a zone Click \"Create\" Step 22. Get the Connection credentials for your new MySQL Instance \u00b6 Under the Google Cloud Platform menu, go to \"Compute Engine\" Find your new MySQL instance and then write down the value written in the \"External IP\" section. Under the Google Cloud Platform menu, go to \"Deployment Manager\" Find your new MySQL instance and then click on it. Write down the values for Admin username and password. (Username should be \"root\") Step 23. Get a MySQL GUI tool so that you can connect to your MySQL Instance \u00b6 You can download MySQL Workbench for this. Step 24. Create a new connection to your MySQL Instance \u00b6 Use the MySQL DB credentials that you saved in Step 21 for this. Step 25. Create a new database/schema in your MySQL Instance \u00b6 You can name your database/schema test_db . Step 26. Create the necessary tables in your MySQL database/schema \u00b6 Run the create_db_tables.sql script in your MySQL database/schema to create all the required DB tables. Step 27. Have your local clone of SeleniumBase connect to your MySQL DB Instance \u00b6 Update the MySQL connection details in your settings.py file to use the credentials that you saved in Step 21. Step 28. Have your SeleniumBase Jenkins jobs use your MySQL DB Instance \u00b6 For the \"Execute shell\", use the following as your updated \"Command\": pytest examples/test_suite.py --headless --with-db_reporting Click \"Save\" when you're done.

This generally means storing passwords in plaintext formats. For security reasons, that may not be an optimal solution. For this reason, encryption/obfuscation tools have been built here to help you mask your passwords in your tests. It's not a bulletproof solution, but it can keep anyone looking over your shoulder during test creation from getting your login passwords if they don't have your encryption key, which is stored in a separate file. Usage \u00b6 First, set your custom encryption/decryption key in your local clone of settings.py . (If you modify the key later, you'll need to encrypt all your passwords again.) Next, use obfuscate.py to obfuscate/encrypt passwords into coded strings: python obfuscate.py Enter password to obfuscate: ( CTRL+C to exit ) Password: ********* Verify password: Password: ********* Here is the obfuscated password: $^*ENCRYPT = RXlYMSJWTz8HSwM = ? & #$ (You can also use unobfuscate.py to encrypt passwords without having them masked while typing them.
